<li>
<p>It’s okay Kermit I have anxiety too</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when kermit is sitting he looks like a distraught bowling pin</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He sounds like a balloon that’s trying to deflate but somebody is holding the opening just making it worse</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why does kermit look like hes having Vietnam flashbacks everyday?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No offense, but Kermit looks like a pigeon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>why does Kermit look like he ate a lemon and never recovered</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Youtube: crying nasty dog</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>16M people: iNtErEsTiNg</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He runs like one of those rats scattering away out of the kitchen when the humans enter the freezer/cupboard in Ratatouille.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I just realised that every whippet has its own expression on their face. Kermit has expression of &ldquo;I watched my mother drown 5 minutes ago&rdquo; while my whipper looks like a crackhead at a gas station at 3 AM</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i think Jenna&rsquo;s dogs are proof that no matter how good you are at training, they still have their own inherent personalities and Kermit&rsquo;s is NASTY. Like drooling everywhere at feeding time? NASTY. His general method of inHaLiNG his food? NASTY. Licking Jenna&rsquo;s legs, clothes, cleaning products, etc? NASTY. Humping other dogs&rsquo; faces at the park? NASTY.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kermit looks like that squirrel from ice age</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kermit licking Jennas foot</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jenna: Kermit that’s nasty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kermit: 👁👄👁</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kermit: thinks about existing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kermit’s face is such an acute triangle when he faces the camera dead on it can either focus on his nose or the rest of his head.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My dog was sitting by me when Kermit Started crying and she looked concerned and she started tilting her head</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this whole video is basically

<p>I could never shout at Kermit he’s to cute and looks like a bowling pin</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kermit looks like an airpod that no longer works</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kermit is both extremely uncomfortable and comfortable at the same time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kermit&rsquo;s interview:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;When was the last time you cried?&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Kermit:</p>
</li>

<p>Jenna: Kermit!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kermit: &hellip;👀</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jenna: That’s nasty!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kermit: 👁👅👁</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kermit looks like he heard that Jenna would quit Youtube forever and never emotionally recovered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my man Kermit looks like he took a hit out of something and is still going through the side effects</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3:55 why is he sending Morse code?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I just rewatched when Jenna got Kermit and he’s always been a crying baby</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This video is about Jenna saying don’t do that Kermit but Kermit does it anyway</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When Kermet was crying i felt sooo bad for him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kermits that one kid who eats sand and cries if you breath in his direction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anyone else watching all of Jennas old videos after her announcement? Anyone else ugly crying? :(</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He looked so happy and proud of himself on the way home after he humped every dog at the park lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When animals complement their owner’s neuroses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel like a parent who has lost custody of the children I grew to love and bonded with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He looks like he&rsquo;s so in pain maybe he misses his family ,friends or maybe also he have some inside pain or problems he needs a doctor literally i don&rsquo;t know anything about that dog or anything am just saying</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WAIT HE LOOKS LIKE PHINEAS WHEN HE FACES FOWARD AGIFJWKDB</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anything at all: exists</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kermit: 👁👄👁</p>
</li>
<li>
<pre><code>          💧     💧
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>I died when he was licking your feet and u said &ldquo;kermit&rdquo; he was like 👁👄👁</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been having so much anxiety. I can&rsquo;t believe that binge watching old Jenna Marbles videos was all I needed to feel OK again, but it was ☺️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me: keeps watching dog content from jenna even though she&rsquo;s quitting youtube</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My mind: MUST SUPPORT JENNA CAUSE I MISS HER BADLY ALREADY

</li>
<li>
<p>Kermit looks like he ate to many flintstone vitamins.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So this isn’t how dogs are suppose to act?- it feel like I’ve learned something-</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me opening a door:</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>The door: 3:59</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kermits whole physique represents nasty</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I hope everyone watches it all the way and isn&rsquo;t skipping like, u came here to deal with this lmao</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kermit really tried to get some</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kermit is a dollar store, Snoop Dogg</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kermit is the prime example of when you&rsquo;ve been quarantined for too long</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love how Kermit skips around like a damn goblin I feel like he would steal your first born</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Kermit that&rsquo;s nasty&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;So anyway I went back to licking her foot&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kermit is the weird kid in the back of the class who eats chapstick and glue</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>How did this get 13k likes?!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been on youtube for years and have only now starting to watch some of Jenna Marbles videos. Why is her content so simple, yet SO enjoyable?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>kermit is the creepy guy they use in commercials to show why you shouldn&rsquo;t let your kids use the internet unsupervised</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I literally watched this whole thing all the way through without skipping at all and I wish there was more of it😂❤️

</li>
<li>
<p>3:59</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes when Kermit cri, it sounds like DE DOOR</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think kermit is in a state of such existential dread that he has to make sounds just to know he’s still alive</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That moment where they got the marble appreciation at 7:04 I felt that I just I love Marble so much he’s just I love him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kermit looks like Rick from the walking dead but dog version idk why tho</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must do asmr of kermits  paws clinging on the ground</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel like he has the brain of a two year old child</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your dog is so derpy looking, that he’s cute as hell</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I had a greyhound who whined constantly😂 he was the most precious greyhound ever</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>kermit sitting looks like a bowling pin that is seeing his last family member dying on their deathbed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>kermit feels like the kid who would eat cookie dough flavored chapstick because they thought it would taste good</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jenna: don&rsquo;t eat it so fast in one bite, you&rsquo;re going to throw up</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Carmeat: <em>eats it in one bite and as fast as he can because he wants to throw up</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1:07 kermit: does a slightly depressive face</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Omg i laughed so hard there</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I bet Kermit had an overall really odd crime record in his past life(and it shows), ' the banshee&rsquo; as they would call him&hellip;BECAUSE HE CRIED ALL THE GODDAMN TIME-</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was a mistake to eat dinner watching this</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I see why the other dogs didn’t want to chase him. hornball! 😭

<li>
<p>He cries like reality show stars when they get in a fight over a guy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you put Cermit on auto tune it would be a masterpiece</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think Kermit cut onions and never recovered</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He&rsquo;s probably crying because his head looks like a bicycle seat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why does Kermit look like he is having flashbacks of the war, all the time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just realized that Kermit is that one meme with the dog that’s whining and they like put a squish face filter on him hahaha</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s been a year and I’m sad theirs no sequel I know the nasty has just intensified.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>This video triggered my doggos big time. They were looking at me thinking I was making the sad cries. Then they snuggled up close to me and started licking me. It was very traumatic for them . I will have to finish this video with headphones in.</p>
</li>
<li>

<li>
<p>My dog is looking at me seriously concerned right now</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can we just talk about how beautiful she looks without makeup 😁😁</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>kermit/cermet/cement looks like he’s trying to warn us about something</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kermit sounds like my windshield wipers without the fluid</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>why is no one talking about kermit aggressively biting jennas foot and then moving forward like nothing happened</p>

<li>
<p>Kermmit when you are saying “good morning” is me when someone i barely know at my school says “happy birthday” to me on my birthday.</p>

<p>I miss jenna and kermit so much, and marbles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kermit is a physical embodiment of my mental state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me being an INFP who also cries randomly throughout the day</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He sounds like cars when the drivers lose control on a turn</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“marble and peach don’t cry, it’s only you”</p>

<p>kermit offended

<p>😂 he&rsquo;s a very vocal doggy.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>We cared for a female husky who was very vocal. We thought she just missed her owners, as she yelped. But we started to reply to her dog language and figured out she was very excited and enjoyed that we returned from work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He cries because of the existential inconvenience of being the middle child.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kermit is the best kind of nasty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I swear are dogs are twins my dog like being nasty and to cry all day</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why y’all so mean o poor Kermit in the comments 😔💔🥺</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Honestly I can relate I cry during random parts of the day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kermit might be a dad soon</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Binging July 2020. Miss you Queen beech. 😥</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Needed this one for sanity today</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I know you’re here after she said she was quitting 😭😢</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>8:58 does he even realize he’s trying to screw another male dog lmao</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every whipper looks like their head is small compared to their body</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remember when Jenna brought kermit home and she thought he was just crying because he was in a new place&hellip;.. lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First 10 seconds</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is she talking about me?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve literally watched this video so many times. Ever since it came out I&rsquo;ve just gotten into the habit of watching it everytime I&rsquo;d get too anxious. I hope Jenna, Julien, and the dogs are doing okay. They&rsquo;re literally my safe place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kermit is a squeaky door whenever he cries</p>

<p>Kermit needs to learn how to ask for consent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This made me cry with laughter. 😂🤦🏼‍♀️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Squidward when Spongebob cries:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You know, i’ve never heard Kermit bark&hellip; I only hear him cri.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Goes to dog park</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Kermit: S E X Y   T I M E</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Was he ever electrocuted</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We got that one quiet behaved kid, the spoiled kid that cries a lot and the sometimes loud kid lmaoooo</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abomination. Its like these dogs were bread to be terrified all the time.</p>

<p>Mr. Marbles: Old texan accent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kermit has a mental break down every second of his life</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I like to spin around on the ground just like Kermit and pretend I&rsquo;m a wheel</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wow I never really Jenna was so average looking without makeup</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is literally my Dachshund, Mr. Beau Jangles (that’s his government name). He’s also SUPER anxious &amp; nasty. He can also be a grumpy old man &amp; he likes to pretend he is this giant bad ass of a dog who will kill anyone that steps into his domain. Mr. Beau Jangles is actually looking &amp; listening to this video right now &amp; crying along with Kermit. I honestly think Beau Jangles &amp; Kermit would be bffs 😂🐕</p>

<p>Day 47 of quarantine: I watched a clip of a naughty and sad dog for my own entertainment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just to honest Kermit is like the kid nobody wants to play with</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe this Beautiful woman with a heart of gold got cancelled, I hate the internet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>why does the algorithm need to torture us with this?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Such an adorable, VERY, very weird Iggy Kermit is. BUT OH SO LOVABLE AT THE SAME TIME!!! 💗❤💜💗 😍😍😍😂😅😂😅😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Put Kermit Peach and Marbles in green suits so only there faces are showing and put them in front of a green screen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love how there&rsquo;s just that small part in the video of Kermit peeing XD</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>8:54 AHHHH ARE WE GONNA IGNORE THOSE 2 ADORABLE PUPPIES IN THE BACKGROUND????!!!</p>

<li>
<p>And when i cry,it sounds like dee door</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kermits eyes are so biiiiiigg</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>they be like:👁👁👁</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The only time we see him happy this entire video is when he just finished sexually harassing other dogs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To calm my pups down we use a blanket that actually wraps around them and they make no sounds but they stiff up but they can still move, we only use them when it’s thundering outside, maybe it might work with Kermit?????&hellip;I honestly do not know</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Marbles barks to protect Jenna</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Peach and nasty be like “is it the time to bark brother Marbles?👀”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>kermint looks like he had drugs and he what his mom to not get mad</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>🤣🤣🤣🤣 I really needed this. Kermit is precious. I feel like he has middle child syndrome, &amp; that’s why he’s constantly trying to get attention</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kermit: breathes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everyone: that is so nasty

<li>
<p>ahhh I’m already missing you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think Kermit is sooooo cuteeeee I just love his personality and I think he’s also sweet sometimes and he just expresses him self A LOT 👍🏻🥰</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kermit looks like a human soul trapped in a dogs body and is constantly crying for help</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes when I miss my dog at work I&rsquo;ll play this video on my break. Kermit doesn&rsquo;t look exactly like my dog but the energy is eerily similar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To me Cermet looks like he was stuffed in a sock for 3 years and he started crying for 5 years straight</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is that Kermit crying or a constant loop of the sounds of my rusty breaks at a stoplight</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How come everything Kermit cries it sounds like a door creaking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nobody:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kermit: Violently tap dance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lol - it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m watching my 15-year-old Min Pin :D He&rsquo;s so spoiled</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and often annoying but I adore him. &lt;3 :D</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when your watching jennas videos after her leaving and just crying: 👁 💧 👄 💧 👁</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kermit has flashbacks of de war</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The title should be : I Filmed My Dog Being My Dog For 24 Hours</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This could have been renamed Kermit ASMR</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hey Jenna I believe you went to new road hotel on London and saw my cousins I really wanted to meet you but I had a really bad flu</p>
</li>
