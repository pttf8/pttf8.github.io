<p>Sky News Australia fans are in for a treat next week: a special one-hour investigation from self-styled investigative journalist Peta Credlin into Victoria’s hotel quarantine failures.</p>
<p>“Peta explores the terrible human cost of the botched quarantine program, revealing devastating new details of how Victoria’s COVID crisis has impacted grieving families and small business owners who no longer have an income due to the lockdown,” the Sky blurb for Deadly Decisions: Victoria’s Hotel Quarantine Catastrophe claims.</p>
<p>We’re no closer to knowing who in the Andrews camp ordered private security for hotel quarantine, Sutton’s testimony has been called into question, and now he’s claimed he wasn’t at a meeting he, in fact, attended. When is it enough? asks Peta Credlin. https://t.co/fXEFIaEqPV pic.twitter.com/43du9rDmDA — Herald Sun (@theheraldsun) October 19, 2020</p>
<p>Credlin is of course better known as Tony Abbott’s chief of staff turned rightwing TV pundit than she is as an intrepid reporter, but she has been exercising her reporting muscles lately.</p>
<p>The News Corp columnist came out from behind her Sky After Dark desk to join the press at Daniel Andrews’s daily update, attracting as much attention for sometimes not covering her nose with her mask as for her aggressive questioning of the premier.</p>
<p>Sky News host Peta Credlin says “Melbournians have had enough”, donning a ‘Free Melbourne’ T-shirt as part of a campaign to protest the “longest and hardest lockdowns in the world”.https://t.co/cIBWU7F7lC — Sky News Australia (@SkyNewsAust) October 20, 2020</p>
<p>Credlin’s colleagues at Sky are gushing. Host Sharri Markson said she “gave the premier an interrogation” and the results were “lethal”. Liberal MP Tim Smith told Markson that Credlin’s performance was “magnificent” and fellow Sky host Alan Jones thanked her for the “wonderful work she’s been doing in prosecuting the case on behalf of all those people who had died as a result of hopeless administration in Victoria”.</p>
<p>Andrews saw it differently, refusing to accept the premise of her statements. “I’m not going to stand here and have things put to me in an attempt to perhaps have them put to me so often that they become the truth,” Andrews said.</p>
<p>Peta Credlin is back interrogating Daniel Andrews at a press conference today. Yes, she works as a broadcaster and is employed by a media company but she is not a journalist, she is a partisan, political operative. Mr Andrews is within his rights to tell her to bugger off. — Chip Le Grand (@Melbchief) October 15, 2020</p>
<p>Others had less patience, saying she should not be given press credentials given her agenda.</p>
<p>Parent trap</p>
<p>Nine Entertainment has slowly been rationalising what drives revenue for the media company and what doesn’t, including offloading websites and smaller newspapers. Now, almost two years after buying Fairfax Media, Nine has made another cut.</p>
<p>The parenting website Essential Baby, which sits across the Sydney Morning Herald, the Age and the Brisbane Times, has had a popular readers’ forum for more than 20 years. The forum predates Facebook and is a place for parents to discuss everything from pregnancy to breastfeeding to toilet training.</p>
<p>But parents will have to gather elsewhere because the forum is closing at the end of the month to save money on moderators.</p>
<p>Essential Baby editor Letitia Rowlands said it has been a place “where parents have come searching for information and understanding”.</p>
<p>“Many who arrived found much more,” Rowlands said. “One-time strangers have become lifelong friends whose support of each other has stretched well beyond the trenches of parenthood and into every part of each other’s lives.”</p>
<p>Cultural criticism</p>
<p>The ABC managing director, David Anderson, certainly adopted the right tone in his opening statement at Senate estimates on Wednesday night when he said the ABC was under an ideological attack.</p>
<p>“Our critics relentlessly try to make us part of a cultural debate most Australians do not find relevant or helpful,” he said. “The ABC is bigger than this debate. And yet public broadcasters around the world face a similar challenge, an assault on their very existence by commercial enterprises that claim that such public services are no longer necessary. The vast majority of Australians disagree.”</p>
<p>He was right. It wasn’t long before Coalition senators were lining up and waging a culture war in real time, asking tedious questions about why the national broadcaster had transgender leave and whether its diversity policy meant staff were no longer hired on merit. At one stage the committee chairman, David Fawcett, shut down Liberal senator David Van for “tedious repetition”.</p>
<p>But the most painful part was the insistence the ABC’s budget had gone up and not down. Anderson said that a total of 229 staff had been made redundant as a direct result of the indexation freeze, but senators weren’t having a bar of it. The ABC’s annual report shows the cost of payouts to this group was $31m alone.</p>
<p>It is true there is an increase in the global budget figure allocated to the ABC – because it includes transmission costs – but once the fixed costs are removed there is $880m of operational funding to spend across all the ABC’s services.</p>
<p>As chairwoman Ita Buttrose has explained, the 2018 budget papers clearly state that the government’s savings measures reduce funding to the ABC by $14.623m in 2019-20, $27.842m in 2020-21 and $41.284m in 2021-22. This reduction totals $83.75m on its operational base.</p>
<p>Anger management</p>
<p>It was an emotional day when seasoned political reporter Laura Tingle let her anger over the loss of so many ABC colleagues boil over on social media.</p>
<p>The trigger was the departure from Aunty after 30 years of senior reporter Philippa McDonald, one in a long procession of well-known ABC talent to walk out the door.</p>
<p>Tingle retweeted McDonald’s farewell video and added that the cuts to the ABC were the result of “government ideological bastardry” and she hoped Scott Morrison was feeling “smug” about it.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a good look for 7.30’s chief political correspondent and she quickly deleted it.</p>
<p>But nothing gets past Senate estimates and the Liberal senator Andrew Bragg asked Anderson if Tingle had breached the ABC’s code of conduct and would be punished.</p>
<p>“Certainly, Laura, I think was contacted by her executive producer,” Anderson said. “I am satisfied that no more action needs to be taken.</p>
<p>“Laura Tingle is a veteran of over 30 years of outstanding journalism. Certainly has been for us. With regard to that tweet, I think, well I know, that Laura deems that to be a mistake.</p>
<p>“I think it was an error of judgment as I think clearly does Laura as she took that tweet down.”</p>
<p>Twice the price</p>
<p>One interesting revelation from estimates was that the ABC has to pay Foxtel for the rights to show some women’s sport. Nothing unusual about paying for content except that Foxtel has been the recipient of two grants totalling $40m from the federal government, so taxpayers are effectively paying twice.</p>
<p>In July, the Morrison government gave another $10m to the Murdoch-controlled Foxtel to boost women’s and under-represented sport, bringing to $40m the total handout to the subscription TV service since 2017.</p>
<p>Under questioning from the Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young, Anderson explained the public broadcaster does not receive specific funding allocations for showcasing women’s sport.</p>
<p>“I’m happy for you to take on notice the details but let me just get clear: the federal government has provided money to Foxtel to provide coverage of women’s sport, which the ABC then has to go to Foxtel to pay for?” Hanson-Young asked.</p>
<p>Reality bites</p>
<p>The Seven network chief executive, James Warburton, admitted it had been a tough year for the network when he unveiled the 2021 schedule via a livestream on Wednesday.</p>
<p>“We had to delay the filming of our longest running drama in Seven’s history, Home and Away,” he said. “We weren’t expecting to lose the AFL for eight weeks and we weren’t expecting an Olympiad without the Olympics.</p>
<p>ANNOUNCING: The world&rsquo;s biggest show is back. 🎤 Australian Idol is coming to Seven. pic.twitter.com/n8X7fj4jNy — Seven Network (@SevenNetwork) October 21, 2020</p>
<p>“Covid didn’t single us out but it sure as hell affected us more than our competitors.”</p>
<p>Seven’s comeback is based on new reality formats piled on old reality formats.</p>
<p>“We’re de-risking the schedule by commissioning proven, powerful formats around the world for our 7.30pm slots,” he said. “We’re not in the programming development game any more. We’re about proven formats.”</p>
<p>Adding to the slate of The Voice, Holey Moley, Ultimate Tag, Big Brother, Farmer Wants a Wife, Australia’s Got Talent and SAS Australia, Seven is bringing back Australian Idol, which last screened on Ten in 2009.</p>
<p>Changing with the Times</p>
<p>Under editor-in-chief Anthony De Ceglie, the West Australian has been focusing on Indigenous disadvantage in a state where children aged 10-17 were 45 times more likely to be jailed than their non-Indigenous peers last year.</p>
<p>De Ceglie told Weekly Beast the National Indigenous Times asked if the West could help the website reach a wider audience. “We suggested a national broadsheet paper insert and this week we produced the first of these special editions of the NIT,” he said. “The NIT produces the content and then my team does the layouts, subbing, design work and helps with pictures. It means the NIT gets in front of our 400,000-plus newspaper readers and it’s a chance to help their website grow.”</p>
<p>Must-read front page of tomorrow&rsquo;s The West Australian via special investigation by @AnnabelHennessy pic.twitter.com/c3trakRqg4 — Anthony De Ceglie (@AnthDeCeglie) October 20, 2020</p>
<p>The insert on Wednesday followed the incorporation of Aboriginal art into the masthead during Reconciliation Week, signing on proud Yawuru man Brenton McKenna as a cartoonist with his comic strip Ole Champ and Annabel Hennessy’s Walkley-winning investigation that saw a domestic violence victim wrongfully imprisoned freed from jail. The print edition of the National Indigenous Times, edited by Hannah Cross, will be inserted every six weeks.

Wyoming Business Tips for Oct. 26-Nov. 1</p>
<p>A weekly look at issues facing Wyoming business owners and entrepreneurs from the Wyoming Small Business Development Center (SBDC) Network, a collection of business assistance programs at the University of Wyoming.</p>
<p>By Bruce Morse, regional director, Wyoming SBDC Network</p>
<p>Consumers have been moving more of their purchases online even before the pandemic hit. However, when COVID-19 did hit, the move to online purchasing accelerated at such a clip that it is leaving some brick-and-mortar businesses wondering how they can compete without a digital storefront and maintain their local customer base.</p>
<p>Moving the business online and offering delivery are some ways local businesses have adjusted, but small businesses also should look at what kinds of value-added services they can add to their existing businesses that would give them a competitive advantage over their larger e-commerce competitors. Small businesses also should avoid the pitfalls that come when they ignore the basics of customer service or staying on message in their social media posts.</p>
<p>Where brick-and-mortar businesses have an advantage over online retailers is in the area of product knowledge and customer service that come from well-trained and experienced staff interacting with customers in the store. This is an advantage you can exploit. Having staff explain options, answer questions, compare products and explain how a product works are the in-real-life aspects missing from the online retail experience. Adding other value-added services, such as delivery and installation, can really make a difference and garner more local sales.</p>
<p>Of course, all of this rests on having a well-trained staff that understands how to talk to customers and create a great in-store experience. As anyone in retail will tell you, all it takes is for one lousy customer interaction to stick with people and, in small communities around Wyoming, word spreads quickly and can have an outsized negative impact on your business.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it is not bad in-store service that can lead to businesses failing, but bad behavior on social media. In this day of instant communication, a business needs to be cognizant of the message that it is sending. It can be very easy for an innocent comment or joke &ndash; even on a personal page or forum &ndash; to be taken out of context and spread like wildfire.</p>
<p>A good rule of thumb is to stay away from commenting on controversial topics, such as politics, race and religion, to name a few. While it may very well be your right to say whatever you want, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that you should. Resist the urge to react to something you read or hear, and fire off a quick one-liner. Fact-check information before you instantly pass it on as true. Instead, take a break. Maybe even sleep on it, and think about the possible ramifications to your business. Most businesses need every customer they can get, so alienating a group of folks that used to patronize your establishment can be extremely costly.</p>
<p>We live in an interesting time, but some time-tested principles still apply. Treat customers well, provide them additional benefits and service enhancements, and keep your marketing message professional and focused. This will go a long way toward building a successful business. If you provide over-the-top service, you do not have to be the lowest-cost provider as people will pay a little extra for that exceptional care.</p>
<p>The Wyoming SBDC Network offers no-cost advising and technical assistance to help Wyoming entrepreneurs think about, launch, grow, reinvent or exit their business. In 2019 alone, the Wyoming SBDC Network helped Wyoming entrepreneurs start 108 new businesses; create or save 3,402 jobs; and bring a capital impact of more than $24 million to the state. The Wyoming SBDC Network is hosted by UW with state funds from the Wyoming Business Council and funded, in part, through a cooperative agreement with the U.S. Small Business Administration.</p>

<p>Strong growth in mainland China: +20.8% like-for-like 1</p>
<p>Commenting on the figures, Mr Jean-Paul Agon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of L&rsquo;Oréal, said:</p>
<p>“In the context of the ongoing epidemic crisis, L’Oréal’s absolute priority continues to be to protect the health of all its employees worldwide.</p>
<p>The Group was able to return to growth as soon as this third quarter thanks to the determination and the relevance of the strategic choices taken in all Divisions and geographic Zones.</p>
<p>After a first half marked by a crisis of supply, linked to the closure of points of sale around the world, L’Oréal put everything in place, as early as June, to stimulate demand for its brands and products and to re-engage all its business drivers. All of the launches initially planned went ahead, business drivers and media investments were strengthened, and “Back to Beauty” plans were deployed with our distribution partners everywhere, in brick-and-mortar and e-commerce, to stimulate the return to consumption. This return to growth is evidence of consumers’ robust appetite for beauty products and our innovations. It is also the fruit of the remarkable commitment of all the teams, who were mobilised in all areas of the Group and in all countries.</p>
<p>All these initiatives enabled us to significantly outperform a beauty market which is still on the road to recovery. The Professional Products Division posted its best quarter in many years, thanks to the reopening of salons and the acceleration of e-commerce. Despite its extensive exposure to the makeup category, the Consumer Products Division returned to growth thanks to a number of commercial operations. L’Oréal Luxe significantly outperformed its market thanks to a very strong launch plan and its unique portfolio of complementary brands. Finally, the Active Cosmetics Division achieved a record quarterly growth, driven by the remarkable success of all its brands. All Divisions were able to seize market opportunities, particularly in the skincare category, where our brands are on the offensive. The teams also harnessed the power of e-commerce 2, which grew at a rate of +61.6% 1.</p>
<p>In geographic terms, North America and all of the new markets returned to growth in this quarter, with remarkable performances in certain countries, such as China and Brazil.</p>
<p>As a result, in a sanitary environment which remains difficult and uncertain, our performance in the third quarter strengthens our ambition to achieve like-for-like growth for the second half, and to deliver solid profitability.”</p>
<p>Sales at 30 September 2020</p>
<p>Like-for-like, i.e. based on a comparable structure and identical exchange rates, L’Oréal group sales came out at -7.4%.</p>
<p>The net impact of changes in the scope of consolidation was +0.5%.</p>
<p>Growth at constant exchange rates came out at -6.9%.</p>
<p>Currency fluctuations had a negative impact of -1.7%. If the exchange rates at 30 September 2020, i.e. €1 = $1.17, are extrapolated to 31 December, the impact of currency fluctuations on sales would be approximately -2.6% for the whole of 2020.</p>
<p>Based on reported figures, the Group&rsquo;s sales, at 30 September 2020, amounted to 20.11 billion euros, i.e. -8.6%.</p>

<p>PROFESSIONAL PRODUCTS</p>
<p>At the end of September, the Professional Products Division was at -10.9% like-for-like and -13.1% reported.</p>
<p>In the third quarter, the Division recorded its best quarterly growth for 20 years at +11.0% like-for-like. Thanks to its far-reaching transformation, which has already led to significant market share gains, and to its solidarity initiatives to support hairdressers, the Division has emerged from the health crisis with an even greater advantage over competitors and a stronger leadership position in the industry.</p>
<p>The Division’s performance was driven by an acceleration on e-commerce and a return to growth in brick-and-mortar points of sale. Its performance was particularly strong in North America and Europe, with double-digit growth in the third quarter, and in China, which continued to accelerate following an excellent first half. The number one category for growth was haircare, spearheaded by a particularly buoyant Kérastase and by the successful launch of Genesis, as well as by the success of Pro Longer by L’Oréal Professionnel. Hair colour grew significantly in the third quarter, driven by Blond Studio by L’Oréal Professionnel and Shades EQ by Redken.</p>
<p>CONSUMER PRODUCTS</p>
<p>At the end of September, the Consumer Products Division was at -6.2% like-for-like and -8.6% reported.</p>
<p>The Division returned to growth in the third quarter at +0.8% like-for-like. During the quarter, Garnier achieved double-digit growth and L’Oréal Paris returned to growth despite its exposure to the sluggish makeup market. The Division capitalised on its “Back to Beauty” plans and on innovations to accelerate in the third quarter in all major categories.</p>
<p>In the third quarter, in hair colour, the Division gained market share in a particularly dynamic category; in haircare, it achieved double-digit growth thanks to the successful launches of Fructis Hair Food and Elvive Dream Lengths; and also accelerated in face care thanks to the launch of concentrated serums rich in active dermatological ingredients by L’Oréal Paris and to the success of Garnier Tissue Masks —an increasingly accessible home beauty ritual. Though the global makeup category remains sluggish, NYX Professional Makeup gained market shares and Maybelline New York successfully launched several products, including Lifter Gloss, in a market where demand is picking up among younger consumers. In the nail colour category, Essie grew strongly, riding the wave of the home manicure trend.</p>
<p>All regions, except for South Asia, returned to growth with particularly encouraging results in mainland China, Brazil, the United Kingdom, Germany and France.</p>
<p>Finally, our digital advance enabled us to accelerate our e-commerce 2 conquest, growing sales in the channel by +49.2% 1.</p>
<p>L’ORÉAL LUXE</p>
<p>At the end of September, L’Oréal Luxe was at -13.1% like-for-like and -11.9% reported in a global luxury beauty market down approximately 19%.</p>
<p>L’Oréal Luxe outperformed the market in all three of its categories. In skincare, it made significant strides driven by its powerful, complementary brands Lancôme, Kiehl’s, Helena Rubinstein and Biotherm. In fragrances, excellent initial sales of three new women’s perfumes, Angel Nova by Mugler, Voce Viva by Valentino and My Way by Giorgio Armani, were major highlights, alongside the continued success of Libre by Yves Saint Laurent and Idôle by Lancôme.</p>
<p>At the end of September, L’Oréal Luxe had gained market shares in almost all Zones. Strong performances were recorded in Asia Pacific, driven by mainland China, which once again posted remarkable growth, as well as in Western Europe, Eastern Europe and Latin America. North America confirmed its progressive recovery. Travel Retail remained heavily impacted by the limited air traffic.</p>
<p>The Division continued to accelerate strongly in e-commerce 2, with global growth of +60.5% 1.</p>
<p>ACTIVE COSMETICS</p>
<p>At the end of September, Active Cosmetics was at +15.2% like-for-like and +10.7% reported, despite the slow dermocosmetics market.</p>
<p>The Division accelerated in the third quarter to reach record growth of +29.9%. The major brands and all geographic Zones grew, and the Division recorded market share gains.</p>
<p>Growth was driven by a major acceleration plan based on a dynamic activation strategy with prescribers, retailers and consumers, both online and offline. The Division’s investments in digital platforms and e-commerce in recent years helped to make the online distribution channel its biggest growth contributor. At the same time, focused post-confinement initiatives at points of sale enabled the sector to return to growth in the third quarter.</p>
<p>Asia and North America continue to be the main growth engines of the Division. The brands CeraVe, SkinCeuticals and La Roche-Posay posted double-digit growth, as well as market shares gains. CeraVe, in particular, is the first contributor to growth with market share gains all over the world and in the major markets.</p>
<p>Summary by geographic Zone</p>
<p>WESTERN EUROPE</p>
<p>At the end of September, the Zone was at -11.8% like-for-like and -10.9% reported. Most countries returned to growth in the third quarter, with France, Germany and the United Kingdom leading the way. On the other hand, Spain was negatively impacted by the drop in summer tourism, and Travel Retail has suffered from the decrease in air travel.</p>
<p>During the third quarter, the consumption of beauty products recovered gradually, though the makeup category remains depressed. All Divisions rolled out major recovery plans to enhance brand visibility during the period. At the same time, e-commerce growth 2 remained buoyant. The Consumer Products Division grew steadily, significantly outperforming the market in the third quarter. Garnier continued to gain market shares, particularly in haircare with the success of its new Fructis Hair Food range, and in hair colour. L’Oréal Paris strengthened its positions in face care, thanks in particular to the excellent start made by its Revitalift Filler serum. L’Oréal Luxe also gained market shares, especially in the fragrance category with the very encouraging launches of Angel Nova by Mugler and My Way by Giorgio Armani. The dynamic La Roche-Posay and CeraVe brands enabled the Division to return to balance at the end of September. Finally, the Professional Products Division saw very dynamic growth in the quarter.</p>
<p>NORTH AMERICA</p>
<p>At the end of September, the Zone recorded -9.7% like-for-like and -9.4% reported.</p>
<p>It made progress in the third quarter. All Divisions maintained growth in the e-commerce channel. The Consumer Products Division is back to growth, despite a sluggish makeup market. It achieved triple-digit growth in e-commerce, has strengthened its leadership position in hair colour, and has improved in the skincare category thanks in particular to Revitalift Glycolic Acid and 10% Pure Hyaluronic Acid by L’Oréal Paris, and to the Garnier Micellar Waters range. Despite the challenges linked to brick-and-mortar distribution, L’Oréal Luxe outpaced its competitors in e-commerce, and outperformed the market in the fragrance category. With double-digit growth in the third quarter, the Professional Products Division confirmed the first signs of recovery noted in June. SalonCentric proved to be a key asset in this robust performance. The Division boosted its digital footprint with Kérastase and more than doubled its sales on Amazon with Matrix and Redken. The Active Cosmetics Division recorded extraordinary growth of over 50% in the third quarter thanks to CeraVe, La Roche-Posay and SkinCeuticals, and to triple-digit growth in e-commerce.</p>
<p>NEW MARKETS</p>
<p>Asia Pacific: The Zone was at -1.8% like-for-like and -2.9% reported, with a return to growth in the third quarter. All Divisions improved their performance. L’Oréal continued to improve and gain market shares during the third quarter outside of mainland China, despite the impact of the pandemic. This improvement was led by skincare, which is the first category of the market. La Roche-Posay and CeraVe gained market share. The major luxury brands recorded strong e-commerce growth. Garnier outperformed the market with new launches in emerging markets. E-commerce continued to accelerate. Offline sales also showed some improvement.</p>
<p>Australia, New Zealand and Vietnam all returned to growth by the end of the nine months. Despite a significant increase in the number of Covid-19 cases in India, the country showed signs of improvement with an increase in sales in the third quarter. Hong Kong continues to suffer due to the absence of tourists.</p>
<p>Mainland China recorded +20.8% like-for-like and +18.1% reported at the end of September, significantly outperforming the market, which continued to recover with growth in the third quarter. The speed of recovery varied significantly depending on the distribution channel and category, but the increase in sales in offline stores and in the selective makeup market was particularly encouraging. L’Oréal China outperformed the market and strengthened its position as the e-commerce and selective distribution leader. All Divisions gained market share.</p>
<p>L’Oréal Luxe outperformed the market, particularly in skincare with Lancôme, Kiehl’s and Helena Rubinstein, but also in makeup thanks to the Chinese Valentine’s Day, during which Yves Saint Laurent became the leading selective brand. The Consumer Products Division performed well in haircare thanks to the launch of the Hyaluronic Acid range by L’Oréal Paris, as well as in skincare. The Active Cosmetics Division recorded strong growth driven by SkinCeuticals and La Roche-Posay. The Professional Products Division returned to double-digit growth in the third quarter.</p>
<p>Latin America: The Zone was at -6.0% like-for-like and -19.3% reported at the end of September. Three Divisions returned to growth in the third quarter. Brazil accelerated in the third quarter, with double-digit growth in all Divisions. All other countries significantly improved sales with Argentina, Uruguay and Chile leading the way. The main growth driver was e-commerce, which more than quadrupled sales in the third quarter. The “Back to Beauty” plan rolled out in most countries maximised opportunities as brick-and-mortar stores slowly reopened. Key innovations, particularly in haircare, Genesis by Kérastase and Série Expert Pro Longer in Professional Products and Dream Lengths in Consumer Products, drove sales. The skincare category achieved double-digit growth driven by CeraVe in the Active Cosmetics Division and by Hyaluro and SkinActive in the Consumer Products Division. L’Oréal Luxe became the market leader thanks to a strong acceleration in e-commerce and the strategic launch of the fragrance Libre by Yves Saint Laurent.</p>
<p>Eastern Europe: At the end of September, the Zone was at -5.5% like-for-like and -10.3% based on reported figures. Markets recovered gradually, particularly in Central Europe, but remained negative in Russia. Bounce back plans were rolled out in June, with promotions and media, as well as new launches in all Divisions and countries.</p>
<p>All Divisions posted growth in the third quarter with particularly strong performances by Active Cosmetics and Professional Products; in terms of countries, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Israel and Romania achieved significant growth.</p>
<p>E-commerce contributed significantly to growth, accounting for 16% of sales.</p>
<p>Africa, Middle East: The Zone was at -9.2% like-for-like and -13.0% reported. In the Middle East, the situation remains difficult, particularly in Saudi Arabia. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the market is steadily improving in South Africa. Recovery plans focused on strong online and offline activations, and on the “Back to Beauty” programme. The Active Cosmetics, Consumer Products and L’Oréal Luxe Divisions drove growth in the Zone, as did the Levant countries, Egypt and Morocco.</p>
<p>Important events during the period 1/7/20 to 30/9/20 and post-closing events</p>
<p>On 31 August, L’Oréal announced the launch of its second Employee Share Ownership Plan. The plan, rolled out in 57 countries, gives L’Oréal employees, in France and internationally, the possibility to be even more closely linked to the Group’s development.</p>

<h3 id="lanai-outbreak-tops-20">&ldquo;Lanai outbreak tops 20&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.mauinews.com/images/2020/10/22055115/lanai-cases-medeiros.jpg" alt="img">
State health officials are investigating a sudden “rapid spread” of COVID-19 on Lanai that could temporarily shut down the island after at least 20 residents tested positive for the virus.</p>
<p>The island’s first-ever four confirmed cases amid the pandemic were reported on Tuesday, followed by another 12 to 15 the next day, and the number of cases could “explode tomorrow” once more results get back, health workers on Lanai said Wednesday evening.</p>
<p>Jared Medeiros, nurse practitioner at Lanai Community Health Center, said that the clinic had 17 positive cases of the 116 tests Wednesday, and Straub Medical Center’s Lanai Clinic confirmed three positive cases, potentially bringing the island’s total to 23. About 136 tests are pending.</p>
<p>The majority of Lanai’s positive cases were among multi-generational households.</p>
<p>“The doctors are recommending a pretty strict shutdown,” said State Sen. J. Kalani English, who represents East Maui, Molokai and Lanai. “We will take quick action, but you can take even quicker action. So we ask that you remain inside unless you absolutely have to go out.”</p>
<p>During a virtual town hall meeting Wednesday night, English and Rep. Lynn DeCoite, who represents the same region, said that they will ask Gov. David Ige today to immediately shut down the island because “time is of the essence.”</p>
<p>Lanai’s health care professionals from the health center, Straub and Lanai Community Hospital recommended state and county officials lock down the island for two weeks and make mass testing available, as well as bring in rapid testing machines.</p>
<p>Maui District Health Officer Dr. Lorrin Pang said he anticipates that cases “will be pretty widespread” and reiterated that residents should follow the five “Ws”— wear a mask, watch your physical distance, wash hands, wipe down surfaces, head for wide-open spaces and make sure you’re well before going out in public.</p>
<p>“For every case we know about, there’s at least three we don’t know about,” Pang said.</p>
<p>The state Department of Health’s Maui District Health Office is actively contact tracing and investigating the cases, as well as educating the residents on how to safely quarantine and self-isolate.</p>
<p>“They have been working closely with the nine medical providers,” said Heidi Taogoshi, public health nursing supervisor for the district office. “Any businesses, schools or establishments that may be involved have been or are in the process of being notified.”</p>
<p>All residents who tested positive for COVID-19 are self-isolating at home; none were hospitalized. Specific information on how and where the outbreak started was not disclosed.</p>
<p>Anyone symptomatic should self-isolate and contact their health care provider, Taogoshi said. Anyone who tests negative for the coronavirus but may have had close contact with a person who tested positive should quarantine for 14 days. DOH has self-isolation units on the island of Lanai and the department is in the process of securing more, she said.</p>
<p>“It’s now more important than ever to follow these recommendations as we see how quickly (COVID-19) can spread,” she said during a Maui County news conference Wednesday. “The good news is, is that it can be stopped just as quickly if we all work together. So there should be no blaming. COVID affects everyone, and don’t be ashamed to get tested.”</p>
<p>Taogoshi added that the Lanai Emergency Preparedness group has been meeting weekly since the beginning of the pandemic, so she is “confident that with the help of everyone, the community will get past this.”</p>
<p>“For the longest time we had no new cases, almost seven months, on the island of Lanai,” Maui County Mayor Micheal Victorino said during the news conference. “It’s quite disappointing that they have started, and I believe there may be more cases coming.”</p>
<p>Intercounty travel will not be affected by the rise in cases at this time, Victorino said, though later in the evening medical professionals suggested adding precautionary measures.</p>
<p>He added that officials will be sending cleaning supplies Friday to sanitize state and county offices on Lanai, making sure high-touch points are disinfected. While unsure of the costs, Victorino said he will try to make the supplies available to Lanai businesses to slow down the spread.</p>
<p>“We’re taking a proactive approach,” he said. “Just like Molokai, just like Hana, Wailuku, whenever a community has had spread, we’ve sent in our disinfectant teams to make sure we sanitize and eliminate any touch points that may be existing in the towns or in any of our businesses.”</p>
<p>The DOH said earlier this week that three of the COVID-19-positive people work at the same location and have symptoms. Another case is a health care worker who does not provide direct patient care.</p>
<p>Taogoshi said “we haven’t identified a certain location or business” and did not confirm whether the additional 12 cases on Wednesday were linked to the initial cases.</p>
<p>“We’re still trying to determine the connection and the investigations are ongoing,” she said. “I don’t have the details of, like if the resident traveled off the island and returned to the island, but I believe that could have been a possibility, but I don’t really want to speak to that because I haven’t verified that with the investigators who are currently working on it.”</p>
<p>Pulama Lana’i, who learned of the first four COVID-19 cases on Tuesday and is the island’s largest employer, did not directly respond to a question as to whether any of the cases were company employees, but did wish “a quick recovery to those affected.”</p>
<p>“The Department of Health is in the process of investigating and contacting anyone who may have come in close contact with the affected individuals,” Pulama Lana’i said in a statement to The Maui News on Wednesday night. “We are working closely with state health and county officials to take all necessary steps in line with public health protocols to ensure the safety of the community.”</p>
<p>English said during the virtual meeting that out of caution, Lanai High and Elementary School will be switching to distance learning effective today for all grade levels due to the outbreak.</p>
<p>There are no confirmed cases linked to the schools.</p>
<p>Principal Elton Kinoshita said that grab-and-go meal services for students will continue from 11:15 a.m. to noon Monday through Friday. Administrators and custodial staff will also still be available in rotating shifts.</p>
<p>Testing will be available to the Lanai community from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Saturday at the Old Dole Administration Building. Residents can call the Straub Medical Center Lanai Clinic at (808) 565-6423 or the Lanai Community Health Center at (808) 565-6919 to make an appointment.</p>
<p>“As you can see, spread can surge very quickly– how it starts, when it starts, where it starts,” Victorino said. “Our contact tracers and our Department of Health and others are looking into it right now.”</p>

António Guterres on Wednesday launch the #PledgetoPause campaign as part of wider efforts to create what the UN hopes will be “a new social media norm” to help combat the impact of viral misinformation.</p>
<p>During the #COVID19 pandemic, the wrong information can be deadly.</p>

<p>The campaign is based on research which indicates that taking a brief pause before sharing information can significantly lessen the inclination to share shocking or emotive material, and slow the spread of misinformation.</p>
<p>Deadly consequences</p>
<p>“During the COVID-19 pandemic, the wrong information can be deadly. Take the pledge to pause and help stop the spread of misinformation”, the UN chief said in a video message recorded for the campaign.</p>
<p>The message, which begins with a five-second pause, will be shared on his Twitter and Instagram accounts, and is designed to be replicated by other leaders, influencers and members of the public.</p>
<p>#PledgetoPause aims to increase media literacy so that social media users can spot misinformation and stop themselves from passing it on.</p>
<p>Break the chain of misinformation</p>
<p>The new campaign is part of Verified, a UN initiative launched in May to share science-backed health information and stories of global solidarity around COVID-19.</p>
<p>The UN describes it as the first global behaviour-change campaign on misinformation, to mobilise experts and researchers, governments, influencers, civil society, businesses, regulators and the media, under a single message: #PledgetoPause.</p>
<p>“COVID-19 is not just a health crisis, but a communications emergency as well. When misinformation spreads, the public loses trust and too often makes decisions that hamper the public response and even their own lives”, said Melissa Fleming, head of the UN’s Department for Global Communications.</p>
<p>“It is increasingly clear that we cannot successfully tackle the pandemic without also addressing online misinformation. Each and every one of us can help break the chain of misinformation by pausing before we share.”</p>
<p>Ms. Fleming added that the UN is also working with social media platforms to recommend changes.</p>
<p>Civil society support</p>
<p>The #PledgetoPause campaign aims to reach a global audience of one billion, online and through partnerships, by the end of December.</p>
<p>Civil society collaborators supporting Pause include organizations from around the world that are fighting misinformation, such as Chequeado, Newschecker.in and First Draft.</p>
<p>African media organizations such as MultiChoice and Yuvaa also are helping to distribute campaign messaging.
