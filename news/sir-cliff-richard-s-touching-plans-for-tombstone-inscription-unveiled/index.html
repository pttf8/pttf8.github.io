<p>Sir Cliff felt that trying to understand why he had survived and others had died was “like trying to work out how The X Factor works”.</p>
<p>He added: “I have no idea more than anybody else. I’ve just made it up as I’ve gone along.”</p>
<p>During his six decades in show business, the star felt there had been times when he was considered to be “quite cool” and later admitted he was perceived as “very uncool”.</p>
<p>Ultimately, he felt that “the only true measure of coolness is success” and concluded: “So, I haven’t done too badly.”</p>
<p>While Sir Cliff admitted he was lucky that his “amazing dream” of becoming a rock and roll star “came true” – every story “needs to have an ending”.

Sir Cliff Richard’s fans will be sorry to hear they may have seen the last of his abs in his annual calendar.</p>
<p>The singer has often posed with his shirt off for his adored calendar – but according to the Mirror, the 80-year-old’s topless days may be behind him.</p>
<p>Sir Cliff apparently delivers the bad news in his new book The Dreamer, telling fans: “I suspect I have done my final topless photo.”</p>

<p>The star has been something of a pin-up for decades, with his calendar flying off the shelves for more than 40 years.</p>
<p>He has sold more than 1.5 million copies of them, as the collection of snaps of the star has become a firm favourite with fans.</p>
<p>A few years ago there were rumours Sir Cliff might retire the calendar, but so far he has kept it going and the 2021 instalment is on its way and available for pre-order now.</p>

<p>According to his website, in the autobiography the singer “tells the story of his incredible life and music legacy”.</p>

<h3 id="cliff-richard-grateful-for-elton-johns-support-through-child-abuse-accusation">&ldquo;Cliff Richard grateful for Elton John&rsquo;s support through child abuse accusation&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article22926133.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_Elton-John-and-Cliff-Richard.jpg" alt="img">
Elton John and Tony Blair reached out to Cliff Richard when he was falsely accused of historic child sex abuse - and the former PM was the only one who made Cliff laugh in a dark time as he mocked himself.</p>
<p>Writing in his new autobiography, Sir Cliff speaks about the 2014 police raid on his home which was filmed by the BBC who put a helicopter above his house.</p>
<p>In 2018, Cliff won a landmark case against the broadcaster about the way they reported that he was being investigated over historical child sexual assault claims. He was never arrested or charged and later decided to sue the BBC for invading his privacy.</p>
<p>(Image: REX/Shutterstock)</p>
<p>Looking back to 2014, he writes: “My life had changed overnight. I had been accused of a heinous crime, awful beyond belief.And the BBC had broadcast that accusation around the world. My family, my friends, my fans, people in every country I had ever played in my career, would have seen that damning BBC footage. People close to me would know I was innocent, of course. But what of the others? What if most people thought: There’s no smoke without fire? My world collapsed. I went into an absolute meltdown.</p>
<p>“Elton John was one of the first people to phone me when the storm broke.</p>
<p>Elton had had his own previous problems with false sex allegations in the media, of course, so he doubtless had some idea of how I felt. As you would expect, he was empathic and encouraging.”</p>
<p>But perhaps the biggest encouragement came from former Prime Minister Tony Blair, who made him laugh but suggesting things could be worse.</p>
<p>(Image: PA)</p>
<p>Sir Cliff added: &ldquo;I was also touched to get a call from Tony Blair. Tony said that he and Cherie didn’t believe a word of the allegations and listened sympathetically as I told him how helpless I felt as I watched my name being traduced across the globe.</p>
<p>‘I can’t even look at the internet, Tony,’ I said. ‘People are saying such awful things about me.’</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tony gave a wry chuckle. ‘You want to see people saying even worse things?’ he asked. ‘ Google my name!’ I even laughed, for a second.”</p>
<p>Cliff admitted that he thought the stress of &ldquo;nightmare&rdquo; would kill him, describing it as “the deepest and darkest hole of my life and I could see no way out”.</p>
<p>He said it was his Christian faith as well as the support of his friends that got him through.</p>

<p>Cliff who turned 80 earlier this month, insists getting older no longer worries him.</p>
<p>In an interview last weekend he said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have any fear of being 80.</p>
<p>The funny thing is, as the years have gone by, each decade has been easier to deal with.</p>
<p>“When I first hit 40, I thought: &lsquo;Oh my goodness, 40.&rsquo; Fifty was absolutely no problem at all, nor 60 or 70. Now that I&rsquo;m at 80, it doesn&rsquo;t feel any different to me. Fortunately, I&rsquo;ve been blessed with good health so that helps.”</p>
<p>But he also admitted the time of the police raid is still “pretty vivid in my mind if I start thinking about it”.</p>
<p>(Image: ITV)</p>
<p>Speaking last week on ITV&rsquo;s Life Stories programme, Sir Cliff also told how he was a fighter at school and left other kids battered and bleeding - to stop being bullied himself.</p>
<p>The singer is known for being softly spoken and a complete gentleman during his seven decade career in pop, but there was another side to him growing up.</p>
<p>He said of one fight: “The guy had me by the wrist and I managed to turn it around and I’ve thrown him down, he was on the floor. And all I did was that and there was all blood here and the bone and everything.”</p>

<h3 id="cliff-richard-reveals-how-gloria-hunniford-helped-him-through-sex-claims-ordeal">&ldquo;Cliff Richard reveals how Gloria Hunniford helped him through sex claims ordeal&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/eab9f/39684020.ece/AUTOCROP/w1240h700/2020-10-30_new_63868565_I1.JPG" alt="img">
Sir Cliff Richard has praised his close friend Gloria Hunniford for helping him cope with being falsely accused of historical sex crimes.</p>
<p>The singer compared his approach to his ordeal with how Gloria dealt with the loss of her daughter Caron to cancer, describing it as something he has to live with but will never get over.</p>
<p>Cliff (80) was exonerated of all charges made by an anonymous accuser in 2014 and then won a High Court case against the BBC in 2018 over its coverage of a police raid on his home.</p>
<p>He explained: &ldquo;Gloria Hunniford had come to support me in court, and afterwards she told me that she had been surprised by my muted response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I thought you&rsquo;d get up and go &ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo; like you do when you win a tennis match!&rsquo; she told me. I shook my head. &lsquo;Gloria,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;all that I felt was extreme relief.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I later saw press photos of me leaving the court, I was horrified at how gaunt and haggard I looked. People have called me the Peter Pan of pop but, that day, I looked more like Rip Van Winkle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor did I feel remotely triumphant. More than anything, I just wished it had all never happened. Because there had been no need.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to dwell anymore now on this dreadful episode in my life because, thank the Lord, it has passed. But I will say this: like Gloria when she lost Caron, I have got past it, but I don&rsquo;t think I will ever get over it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not fully. It did too much damage and it left too much of a stain on my life. It&rsquo;s certainly not the kind of thing you can ever just forget.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t forget, but you can try to move on and that was exactly what I intended to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his new autobiography, The Dreamer, Sir Cliff revealed that he also turned to Gloria - whose daughter Caron was 41 when she died from breast cancer in 2004 - when he himself had a loved one suffering from the disease in 2015.</p>

<p>He explained: &ldquo;My sister Joan&rsquo;s daughter, Linzi, the youngest of her three children, died of cancer on 29 June. She was just 35-years-old.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Normally, parents die before their children, of course, but every now and then, life&rsquo;s regular patterns break down. I saw how difficult it was for Gloria Hunniford when she lost her beloved daughter, Caron Keating, also to cancer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It took Glo a long time to deal with it. I remember when she said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll get past it. But I&rsquo;ll never get over it.&rsquo; When Linzi was diagnosed with cancer, I witnessed what a mother goes through again as I saw Joan&rsquo;s anguish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glo, being Glo, called Joan. I don&rsquo;t know what she said, but my sister found her words wise and comforting, and told me that it was wonderful to talk to someone who knew exactly what she was going through and exactly what she was feeling. Joan and I will always be grateful to Glo for helping Joan &lsquo;get past&rsquo; her own loss.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cliff first met Portadown-born Gloria when she was a reporter with UTV and he was in Lisburn to play a gospel concert at a church in 1970.</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;I liked her immediately - but I had no way of knowing that Gloria Hunniford was later to become one of my very closest friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gloria is wonderful. People have asked me so many times if I enjoy being interviewed by her, and I always say, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve never been interviewed by Gloria&hellip; We have a conversation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She sits, listens, holds eye contact and you have a proper chat. It&rsquo;s why Gloria and I get on so well and one of the many reasons why she is still one of my best friends in the world. A very different kind of broadcaster.&rdquo;</p>

Cliff Richard vows to stop posing for topless photos</p>
<p>By Andy Malt | Published on Friday 30 October 2020</p>
<p>Cliff Richard has announced that he plans to stop posing for topless photos when making his annual calendar. But it’s not clear if there will be nipples in the 2021 offering.</p>
<p>“I suspect I have done my final topless photo”, he says in new book ‘The Dreamer’. “I suspect it’s time to gracefully exit the Chippendales market”.</p>
<p>However, he adds, before you make any suggestions, that decision has nothing to do with his 80 year old physique. He recalls how, after his 2020 calendar was revealed, “Chris Evans said on the radio that it couldn’t be my body – they must have superimposed my head onto somebody else! That made me laugh”.</p>
<p>Out this week, ‘The Dreamers’ is described by publisher Ebury Press as the “definitive” Richard autobiography, coming twelve years after his last book, ‘My Life, My Way’.</p>

<p>The One Show returned with Alex Jones and Rylan Clark-Neal at the helm of Wednesday evening’s programme and they soon revealed they would be joined by a very special guest in the form of Sir Cliff Richard. The star has recently celebrated his birthday and will be releasing an autobiography entitled Cliff Richard: The Dreamer later this week. However, whilst probing the musician with a host of questions, Alex Jones was left stunned after she discovered the guest’s real name was entirely different, admitting to him: “I didn’t even realise!”</p>
<p>Cliff was welcomed onto the BBC programme, with Rylan and Alex ready and waiting to quiz him on his long-running career. The star has been performing for over six decades and is set to release his 105th album in just a few days time.</p>
<p>However, as the pair fired away with their questions, Alex made an admission to Sir Cliff. When the topic of how his stage name had been curated, the host confessed she had no idea it wasn’t his “real name.” READ MORE: Martin Roberts: Homes Under The Hammer host on new problems for show</p>

<p>The One Show: Cliff Richard spoke about the reason behind his name change</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, we went to a pub and sat down thinking of names.&rdquo; He went on to explain how he went through a selection of similar combinations before landing on the namesake he’s known and loved for today. Sir Cliff added: “The last combination was Russ Clifford and I said I didn’t like that and they said, ‘What about Cliff Russard,’ “I went Cliff – rock face, I got that and somebody changed it to Richards with an s on the end and the guy that wrote Move It for me, my guitarist at that stage, he’s the one that said, ‘Take the S off Richards, you’ve now got two Christian names and they’re bound to get it wrong.

<p>And the guest went on to reveal the genius move behind the name He added: “When you do an interview they’re going to call you Cliff Richards, you can correct them and that means that they’ve had to use the name twice!” After Cliff&rsquo;s explanation, Rylan reiterated their surprise, adding: &ldquo;We never knew!! We’ve always known you as Cliff Richard” &ldquo;You must admit, it’s better than Harry Webb isn’t it!?” Cliff remarked.

<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/27/02/34881850-0-image-a-38_1603764362880.jpg" alt="img">
Sir Cliff Richard has shared a harrowing picture documenting his ordeal with shingles.</p>
<p>The beloved singer was so affected by the stress of being falsely accused of historical sex crimes that he began suffering from shingles, which could have left him blind.</p>
<p>The 80-year-old, who was exonerated of all charges made by an anonymous accuser in 2014, became so unwell during the investigation that it took a devastating toll on his health.</p>
<p>Sir Cliff Richard, 80, has shared a harrowing picture documenting his ordeal with shingles brought on by the stress of being falsely accused of historical sex crimes</p>
<p>A never-before-seen photo shows the painful rash the entertainer had while he stayed in his home in Portugal in the midst of the accusations.</p>
<p>‘I had been through a really, really bad time of my life. I went through a terrible time,’ he said as the picture was shown on Piers Morgan’s Life Stories on ITV on Sunday night.</p>
<p>‘Within four months of my accuser setting fire to my life, I had a pimple on my head and I was in Portugal so I called a friendly doctor I know and said, “Can you come and see me, I don’t know what’s wrong”.</p>
<p>‘He came the next morning and he said, “You have shingles”. And I said, “Well how can I get shingles?” and he said, “Stress”.’</p>
<p>Pointing out how bad it could have been, Sir Cliff added: ‘It was so dangerous – do you see how close it got to my eyes? Had it happened on my eye I might have gone blind.’</p>
<p>A never-before-seen photo shown on Piers Morgan’s Life Stories shows the painful rash he got in the midst of the accusations that could have blinded him</p>
<p>The South Yorkshire Police raided Sir Cliff’s home in 2014 after he was accused of a historic sex crime, coverage of which was aired on the BBC.</p>
<p>He successfully sued the corporation and is thought to have received more than £2million towards his legal costs and £280,000 in damages in 2018.</p>
<p>He said that he was happy to show the graphic photograph to the world because he had found it hard to describe how the stress of the situation had manifested itself in his life.</p>
<p>‘It’s very difficult for me to explain what it was like for me to wake up every day at 3.15am and the last thing you think of before you go to bed and the first thing you think of when you wake up is that accusation, which I knew was false, God knows was false,’ he said.</p>
<p>The 80-year-old singer was exonerated of all charges but became so unwell during the investigation that it took a devastating toll on his health (Pictured in 1971)</p>
<p>Later in the programme, Sir Cliff said that he had once collapsed on the kitchen floor over the weight of the allegations and the realisation of the impact they could have on his life.</p>
<p>‘I had fallen down because what I had thought was, “Oh my God, I’m in a pit and I don’t know how to get out of this pit. My career rests on it, everything, everything that I’d lived for rested on this”.</p>
<p>‘I’m thinking I could actually end in prison as an innocent man. And suddenly my legs just wobbled, went wobbly and I went to the floor.’</p>
<p>During Sunday’s programme, members of the socially distanced audience were shown wearing homemade coronavirus masks with Sir Cliff’s image printed on them, pictured.</p>
<p>The entertainer turned 80 this month and was able only to celebrate with five friends under current lockdown restrictions.
