<p>Kingswood secures £15m of forward funding Sarah Townsend</p>
<p>The housebuilder has agreed a multi-site financing facility with government agency Homes England, to help spur its planned expansion.</p>
<p>The loan facility will help forward fund the delivery of four sites with planning consent for more than 200 homes and a gross development value in excess of £50m, according to Kingswood Homes. It is also a platform that could be used to fund additional sites.</p>
<p>Preston-based Kingswood, whose schemes include The Hollies, at Forton in Lancashire, and the Green Hills neighbourhood south-west of Blackburn, among others, wants to double the number of homes it completes each year to 200.</p>
<p>Kingswood Homes’ managing director Paul Jones said: “The agreement gives us access to one central fund that can be used tactically across all our sites. It gives us much more flexibility, allowing us to respond to market demand and move resources to where they are most effective.</p>
<p>“[The deal] also creates a platform that should ultimately allow us to fund additional sites within the funding structure, enabling us to continue to grow in a more efficient way, by saving time and reducing the level of additional costs.”</p>
<p>A statement from Homes England said: “We are pleased to be able to provide a flexible funding structure to help support the continued growth of Kingswood Homes. The structure highlights the ability we have within the Home Building Fund to structure a finance package matched to the specific needs of a partner.”</p>
<p>Last year, Kingswood delivered a range of homes at sites both in Lancashire – The Hollies – and outside the region, in Devon.</p>
<p>In Blackburn, planning for further phases at the Green Hills development was granted this year, including detailed consent for 155 homes and outline permission for a further 280. The first phase was designed by Hemingway Design.

Gladys enjoys violin performance to mark 100th birthday celebration</p>
<p>by Danielle Thompson (October 2020)</p>
<p>A CENTENARIAN marked her special day with a ‘sherry good time’ - and a socially-distanced violin performance.</p>
<p>On Saturday, October 24, Gladys Stanway of The Hollies Rest Home on Mornington Road, celebrated her 100th birthday with family and friends.</p>
<p>Katie Howard, compliance and support manager at the home said: “The family worked hard behind the scenes with us to create a special day. Everything was kept a surprise from Gladys and she knew nothing about the plans.</p>
<p>“Her granddaughters, Nicky and Dawn, and son-in-law, Peter, came to The Hollies with a small group of violinists who played Happy Birthday to Gladys from the car park whilst she remained inside at the top of stairs.</p>
<p>“Everyone maintained social distancing throughout the performance and they were sheltered from the elements as best as possible. The family remained sat by the front door and wore their masks throughout the visit and Gladys was sat behind a Perspex screen to ensure that we minimised any risk.</p>
<p>“After a small lunch, Gladys had a Sherry aperitif with everyone else at The Hollies where music was played and then a buffet was put on for all the residents to enjoy.</p>
<p>“We would like to wish Gladys a very happy 100th birthday.”

An aerial view of The Hollies and surrounding plot.</p>
<p>The impressive stone-built property in Bridge Street is to be sold on behalf of Derbyshire County Council by SDL Auctions in its commercial property auction on Friday, October 30, with a guide price of £300,000.</p>
<p>Believed to have been built in the 1870s, the property was once a grand private house known as The Hollies.</p>
<p>It was owned by a doctor who ran a surgery there, before it was sold to Derbyshire County Council in 1937.</p>

<p>Its sale presents a rare development opportunity, according to auctioneers.</p>
<p>Managing director and auctioneer Andrew Parker said: “This is a fantastic opportunity for an enterprising investor to help shape this award-winning market town by redeveloping this fascinating character property.”</p>
<p>The extensive property spans four floors, including a basement, and sits on a large plot with a car park and a sizable green space which backs onto playing fields.</p>
<p>Andrew added: “The Hollies offers huge potential for a number of uses, including residential, with the space for a new-build extension, all subject to the necessary planning permissions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a town as popular as Belper, there is always demand for attractive housing, so we feel it would lend itself particularly well to a residential conversion, such as high-end self-contained apartments, although we urge potential buyers to consult Amber Valley Borough Council before bidding.”</p>
<p>The old library was replaced by a new £1.7 million library in Derwent Street, which opened its doors in August.</p>
<p>Derbyshire County Council leader and cabinet member for strategic leadership, tourism and culture, councillor Barry Lewis, said: “We were delighted to finally be able to open the doors to our new library in Belper and hope people who visit will agree with us that it was worth the wait.</p>
<p>“It is quite unusual for local authorities to be opening new libraries and this demonstrates our commitment to the library service and all that it has to offer to our residents.</p>
<p>“It’s a stunning building which is light, airy and bright with windows along one wall letting the public see into the building and the stock and services on offer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It combines the old and the new, bringing different elements together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It’s modern, the stock is easy to access and there’s a lovely children’s section. It’s definitely worth a visit.”</p>
<p>All customers are being asked to wear face coverings when visiting a library, unless they are in an exempt group, and will also be asked to leave their details as part of the test and trace programme.</p>
<p>The old library, The Hollies, will be sold on Friday, October 30, the second day of SDL Auctions’ two-day auction, which will be dedicated to commercial properties.

<p>A Hessle Road &ldquo;legend&rdquo; who ran the street’s oldest store for years has died after a long battle with illness.</p>
<p>Peter Maltby was the face of the hugely popular Maltby’s Stores for years before enjoying his well-earned retirement.</p>
<p>The store, which sells pet and garden supplies, was established in 1904 and is still going strong today.</p>
<p>Pete passed away on Tuesday, October 20 at the Hollies Care Home Hessle after a long illness.</p>

<p>Brother Jeff Maltby says his brother was key to keeping the store successful and he charmed everyone he met.</p>
<p>He said: “Pete took over running Maltby’s Stores in 1982 following his father’s retirement and went on to gain the respect of everyone he came into contact with. He was a legend in Hessle Road.</p>
<p>“They loved his wit, charm and wicked sense of humour and, despite many an expletive, his personality always shone through.</p>
<p>“He was so well known that wherever he went over the years, be it the UK or abroad. he always ran into someone he knew. He always took pride in telling everyone he was from Hessle Road.”</p>
<p>Pete was born on June 19, 1940 in a room above the family shop Maltby’s Stores and he arrived on the first day the bombs dropped on Hull during World War Two.</p>
<p>The son of the late Norman and Mary Maltby, corn merchant and pet shop owners and brother of Jeff and the late Norma.</p>
<p>In his youth Pete was Yorkshire School’s High Jump champion. He was also a talented footballer but due to his modesty he turned down an offer from then manager Bob Brocklebank to join Hull City in 1956, thinking that others were more deserving.</p>
<p>He continued to be involved in football by playing and managing a Hull Sunday football team named Compton Sports for twenty five years.</p>
<p>Along with all the ups and downs that football brings, they did become the first team outside of the first division to win the Sunday Football cup in 1963.</p>
<p>His brother Jeff said: “He had a passion for Hull City and Hull FC and to see City involved in the Premier League for five seasons and get to an FA cup final and to see FC eventually win at Wembley were all joys to behold.”</p>
<p>Pete married his teenage sweetheart Natalie in 1963, they had two children, Paul and Kathryn. Later years brought him five grandchildren, Adam, Aimie, George, Nathan, and Amber all of whom he adored.</p>
<p>He retired at the age of 62 knowing he had left the shop in the safe and capable hands of Paul and Kathryn.</p>

<p>In retirement Pete and Natalie travelled extensively and fulfilled many of their dreams such as travelling to Graceland to see the home of Elvis Pressley and watching their old friend Jeff Leyton perform as Jean Valjean in the production of Les Miserables many times.</p>
<p>In later life Pete suffered with dementia and spent his last few years at the Hollies Care Home in Hessle.</p>
<p>Jeff said: “He never lost his wit and despite his choice of words, the staff loved Pete. He even survived contracting Covid-19 to celebrate his eightieth birthday in June this year.</p>
<p>“We send our heartfelt gratitude to all the care home staff for their amazing personal care and attention paid to Pete, making his stay there happy and comfortable especially during his final hours.</p>
<p>“Pete leaves us knowing that his legacy is in the safe hands of his children, grandchildren and their partners who are all employed at Maltby’s Stores and do their upmost to ensure that the business continues to thrive.”</p>
<p>Pete’s funeral will be held at 1.30pm on Wednesday, November 11 at Chanterlands Avenue Crematorium.</p>
<p>Due to current restrictions only limited numbers of family and friends are able to attend.</p>
<p>Anyone wishing to pay their respects can do so by lining the streets to watch the cortege as it travels down Hessle Road and passes Maltby’s Stores at around 1pm.

<h3 id="why-do-leaves-change-color-in-the-fall">&ldquo;Why do leaves change color in the Fall?&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://whnt.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2020/10/Fall-Colors.png?w=1280" alt="img">
You can always expect your landscape to be filled with a myriad of fall colors as your trees and shrubs go dormant for the winter. You’ll see yellows, purples, oranges, and reds during the transition. But what’s actually happening during this change?</p>
<p>Deciduous trees and shrubs are ones that will lose their leaves in the winter. During the summer, the green chlorophyll pigment is what you see, and it’s what’s most responsible for photosynthesis. But as temperatures fall and day length gets shorter in the fall, the chlorophyll breaks down and photosynthesis stops, ultimately revealing other pigments in the leaves.</p>
<p>Yellow, orange, and brown have always been there, but were hidden by the chlorophyll. Red pigment, however, is actually produced in the fall, and may be more intense when we’re experiencing a mild, wet fall season.</p>
<p>You may be used to certain trees, like maples, having great fall color before the entire tree goes naked for the winter, but did you know that many evergreens also have fall color? Even though they keep their foliage in the winter, some evergreens, like azaleas and hollies, will lose their older inside needles, making them shed and transition into the winter.</p>

A: I don’t think I have ever seen a tree that I thought was killed by woodpecker damage. I am not saying it can’t happen, since anything that pierces the bark is somewhat damaging, but I have seen trees with hundreds of holes that seem perfectly healthy. Sapsucker woodpeckers make very shallow holes. The depressions need only be deep enough to exude sap from the tree’s cambium layer. My observation is that trees have no problem healing from this kind of damage. I don’t believe there is an effective or practical way to deter the birds. If you water your wax myrtle when it is dry in summer, it should be fine despite the unsightliness.</p>
<p>Q: I have 20 well-established ‘Nellie Stevens’ holly trees. We expected to get an abundance of red berries during the winters; however, we get very little on each tree. I planted a male ‘Edward Stevens’ to help but it didn’t do anything. Kerwin Cortez, email
