<p>Elvis was fickle in his personal life, taking frequent lovers while in relationships and then married, and allowing little opportunity for anyone to countermand his ever-changing wishes. By contrast, he expected absolute loyalty and fidelity from everyone around him. He was notoriously unforgiving and occasionally violent if he felt anyone had betrayed him. He didn&rsquo;t just shoot televisions, on this one particular occasion he also physically attacked someone very close to him during an extraordinary sequence of events.</p>
<p>The night in question happened during Elvis' long residence at The International Hotel in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The King would frequently hang out with Tom Jones – and not just at afterparties. Elvis used to love turning up to surprise Sir Tom&rsquo;s audiences mid-show.</p>
<p>The Welsh star was not quite as delighted, and would tell his crew to &ldquo;hide the microphones&rdquo; to prevent the American from trying to upstage him.</p>
<p>Journalist and writer Chris Hutchins was handling Sir Tom&rsquo;s PR at the time and also became friends with Elvis and Priscilla. He described the shocking events of one particular night.</p>

<p>They have two of the greatest voices in the history of popular music. Both were also major sex symbols to their adoring fans and both enjoyed hugely successful runs in Las Vegas. Elvis actually approached Tom Jones at a TV special in 1965 when the Sex Bomb star was just starting out his career and their friendship grew over the years. Sir Tom has even remained close to Elvis' ex wife Priscilla, more than forty years after his fellow superstar died at 42.</p>
<p>Sir Tom embarked on a wildly successful Vegas career in 1967 with his first engagement at The Flamingo. He would perform at least a week in Vegas every year until 2011. It was hugely lucrative and he was such a draw, stars like Liberace, Dionne Warwicke, Debbie Reynolds and Joan Rivers attended his birthday parties there.</p>
<p>Sir Tom&rsquo;s success was one of the reasons Elvis also decided to revive his flagging career in the late 1960s by headlining the newly opened International Hotel in 1969.</p>
<p>The pair would notoriously party late into the night in hotel suites, accompanied by alcohol and adoring women, although better behaviour was ensured whenever their wives were around.</p>
<p>Elvis’ lifelong friend and core member of the Memphis Mafia, Jerry Schilling, paid tribute to their friendship: &ldquo;Elvis didn&rsquo;t really hang out with other entertainers that much, but if there was one artist that Elvis truly called a friend and hung out with the most, it was Sir Tom Jones.</p>

<h3 id="tom-jones-of-the-whalley-wine-shop-explains-what-you-need-to-know-about-vegan-wines">&ldquo;Tom Jones of the Whalley Wine Shop explains what you need to know about vegan wines&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.lep.co.uk/webimg/QVNIMTE3NzUyMzI0.jpg" alt="img">
To be called a ‘wine’, the only product allowed to be used as the base is the juice from grapes (small exceptions exist for ‘fruit wines’ like damson and elderflower, but these will always say that on the label). However, during the process of making the wine several things are allowed to be added, the most common and obvious being sugar and yeast, needed for the fermentation process.</p>
<p>What makes a wine non-vegan is the addition of a few ingredients that are often used as ‘fining agents’. Before a wine is complete it’s often cloudy with tiny particles of grape pulp and skin. Most customers don’t want a cloudy wine (though this is changing slightly) so a process of ‘fining and filtration’ is undertaken. ‘Fining’ is the addition of substances (often animal products) to make the tiny particles clog together so they’re big enough to be filtered. They do not remain as part of the wine, but the use of these animal products is enough to make the wine non-vegan.</p>
<p>There are three main culprits – gelatin, albumin and casein. Gelatin was often used to fine out wines, especially those with excess tannins, but is becoming much rarer. The albumin in egg whites can also play a crucial role as a fining agent in fine wine production, especially Burgundy, where it will absorb harsh and bitter tannins and leave behind the softer more desirable ones. Casein is a protein from milk and when used in a salt form (sodium caseinate) is another non-vegan fining agent.</p>
<p>Sign up to our daily newsletter The i newsletter cut through the noise Sign up Thanks for signing up! Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later. Submitting&hellip;</p>
<p>The ‘fining’ process takes place in the cellar, and involves adding agents such as egg white to remove impurities. This can make a wine non-vegan, but there are alternatives. Picture: LEO HAU/PIXABAY</p>
<p>Finally the use of Isinglass, a protein obtained from the dried bladders of sturgeon and other freshwater fish, has been used since 1660. It is added as a powder or liquid and was historically used instead of gelatin and very popular in the beer industry. It’s important to stress none of these products are harmful to humans or affect the flavour (unless used improperly), but their use in the production stage does make wine non-vegan.</p>
<p>However, many producers are moving away from these older methods and, in response to the demand for vegan-friendly wines, have sought out new alternatives, such as Bentonite Clay. As a result we now have dozens of vegan wines available in the shop, and this month will be highlighting those with ‘vegan’ neck collars. We have also produced a six-bottle mixed vegan case for just £60, including:</p>
<p>Sacchetto ‘Fili’ Extra Dry Prosecco – Veneto, Italy, 11.5%, NV. £13.99 a bottle</p>
<p>This high quality prosecco is beautifully presented in a skittle-shaped bottle and has long been a shop favourite. Lovely soft citrus notes combine with some gentle fruit and a delicate fizz. ‘Extra dry’ is somewhat misleading, as it is slightly softer and fruitier than the ‘Brut’ classification. Makes an ideal aperitif or great with tempura vegetables.</p>
<p>Tom Jones of the Whalley Wine Shop</p>
<p>San Marzano ‘Talo’ Verdeca – Puglia, Italy, 12.5%, 2019. £11.49 a bottle</p>
<p>This relatively unknown grape variety has been a bit of a revelation for us. Ideal for people who drink Pinot Grigio but maybe want to explore something new and with a bit more character. This lovely dry white shows notes of aromatic white flowers, crisp green apple and a soft hint of honey. Soft flavour, rounded texture and a crisp refreshing finish. Superb with an Italian herb salad.</p>
<p>Herdade do Rocim ‘Mariana’ Red – Alentejo, Portugal, 14%, 2019. £9.99 a bottle</p>
<p>Produced organically in one of the most exciting Portuguese wine regions and manually harvested to reduce emissions, this is a blend of native grapes Touriga Nacional (40%), Aragonez (30%), Alicante Bouschet (20%) and Trincadeira (10%) and is fermented using ‘Indigenous yeasts’ – those found naturally in the vineyard. A rich blend of juicy cooked berry fruit with some nice spice, a rich and rounded mouthfeel, good soft tannins and a very subtle hint of toasty oak in the finish.</p>
<p>Well-rounded, and perfect for a rich tomato-based curry.</p>
<p>This relatively unknown grape variety has been a bit of a revelation for us</p>
<p>Madeira toast</p>
<p>This week I was lucky enough to try a wine from 1907 – 113 years old!</p>
<p>It was from a bottle of Madeira, the tiny Portuguese island off the coast of Africa. Historically an incredibly important trading port and wine producing region, the American declaration of independence was toasted with Madeira!</p>
<p>The distinctive wines got their character from being heated on long sea journeys and made them incredibly durable and long lived. It has resulted in these fabulous old bottles still being available and still being in good condition.

<p>A family are fighting to save a Welsh pub where Tom Jones used to rehearse after the landlord died with Covid-19.</p>
<p>Keith Peacock, 76, had run The Thorn Hotel, in Abercynon, for 23 years and was working ‘flat out’ repairing damage to the venue when the pandemic hit. He then caught the virus and died three weeks later, despite being described as ‘fit and healthy’ by family.</p>
<p>His grandson Nicky Batchelor, 35, is now battling to save the pub and has begun crowdfunding to repair the work started by Mr Peacock. The 130-year-old building was badly damaged during last year’s winter weather, he said.</p>

<p>Mr Batchelor went on: ‘During the pandemic, my “grancher” Keith had been working flat out renovating the pub after damage during last year’s very bad winter. He was up on the roof, carrying boards, building a new bar, determined to finish the job.</p>
<p>Visit our live blog for the latest updates Coronavirus news live</p>
<p>‘We talked about building a kitchen to create more jobs for young people in the valleys and making food using local produce and supporting growers at the local allotment.</p>
<p>‘We talked about takeaways to people who lived at home on their own and more opportunities for the community to come together, especially now more than ever, we all needed each other. He was so fit and healthy, fitter than me.</p>
<p>He died with coronavirus three weeks after becoming infected (Picture: Wales News Service)</p>
<p>Tom Jones used the space to rehearse (Picture: Wales News Service)</p>
<p>‘Then coronavirus hit. He got ill and sadly died at home in the pub that he loved, just three weeks later. I am devastated, the whole family are, he was on the mend. Doctors had sent him home. We all thought he’d be back on that roof in no time.</p>
<p>‘He didn’t get to finish the job he wanted to do and I’ve made a promise that I will do whatever I can to finish the job and make him proud and I am reaching out to see if anyone could spare any support and help.’</p>
<p>Mr Peacock, who was a Cardiff City season ticket holder and an Abercynon RFC steward, had raised thousands for charity through holding live gigs and karaoke nights at the pub, his family said.</p>
<p>Tom Jones and Stereophonics both rehearsed in a room above the pub while beginning their careers.</p>
<p>The pub was badly damaged in last year’s winter weather (Picture: Wales News Service)</p>
<p>At present, only half the pub is usable, and Mr Batchelor is keen to finish the site’s beer garden so customers can socially distance while drinking outside. He has raised £8,400 so far and believes they need around £10,000 to finish the project.</p>
<p>He said: ‘I would love to finish the job my grandad started, to make my granch proud and to re-open the pub, so we can bring the community back together again.’</p>
<p>The crowdfunding campaign can be found here.</p>

Kathee Jones employs an ancient art to wrap precious stones</p>
<p>By JUDY BERMAN</p>
<p>Kathee Jones' unique jewelry is on display at the Art Gallery of Viera.</p>
<p>Kathee Kit Jones and her husband, Tom, design unique jewelry with their earrings, bracelets and necklaces that highlight the ancient art of Chainmaille.</p>
<p>Chainmaille is created with small metal rings linked together. Their styles of Byzantine, Full Persian, Helm Weave and Box Weave are on display at the Art Gallery of Viera in The Avenue.</p>
<p>Both own Waterfront Street Jewelry, an online company.</p>
<p>Their jewelry uses a lot of raw copper, and the weaves wrap around precious stones.</p>
<p>“They’re universally interesting. They’re all one-of-a-kind. I think my work is unexpected,” said Kathee Jones of Melbourne.</p>
<p>Tom Jones views their designs as “something you would want to take home to your wife.”</p>
<p>“Kathee likes to make beautiful things, to make people smile. That makes her day. I’m the same way,” Tom Jones said.</p>
<p>Both took an interest in learning this art about six years ago. YouTube tutorials helped her learn how to make the jewelry designs. As she practiced the craft, she learned.</p>
<p>She teaches the technique in classes at the gallery.</p>
<p>“We learn from one another. That’s why the gallery’s so good,” Kathee Jones said.</p>
<p>Their advice for those who want to learn jewelry design: Find a good mentor, be open to feedback and patience is key.</p>
<p>“Everybody wants to be the best right away, but it takes time,” Tom Jones said.</p>
<p>One of Jones’ students, Teri Mahnken, said that, pre-pandemic, she was looking to learn something different, and Jones' classes were a perfect fit.</p>
<p>“I like to work with beads and cabochon,” said Mahnken, a resident of Indian Harbour Beach.</p>
<p>Cabochon is an undrilled stone — rounded on one side and flat on the reverse.</p>
<p>The process “was intimidating at first. Then you feel you’ve accomplished something when you’re done,” said Mahnken, who already has sold some of the pieces she’s made in class.</p>
<p>Tom Jones is working on wire trees. He joked that these trees are more low-maintenance than bonsai trees, as his creations don’t grow or require watering.</p>
<p>For Kathee Jones, she’s designing greeting cards as well as earrings for the holidays.</p>
<p>“I have always had the soul of an artist. My creations pour out of me in many forms. I write. I paint. I take photos and I design jewelry,” Kathee Jones said.
