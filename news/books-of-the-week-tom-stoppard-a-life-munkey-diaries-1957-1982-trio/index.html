<p>Hermione Lee’s biography of Tom Stoppard is an “astute and unfailingly clear” commentary on the playwright’s life and work. Jane Birkin’s diaries, addressed to her toy “Munkey”, reveal a troubled icon given to “self-loathing”. And William Boyd’s new novel set in Brighton in 1968 has a mood that’s a “mix of frolicsome and melancholy”.</p>
<p>Book of the week</p>
<p>Tom Stoppard: A Life by Hermione Lee</p>
<p>Despite being our most famous living playwright, Tom Stoppard is a writer who divides opinion, said Stefan Collini in The Guardian. His plays make you think and laugh, but there’s often that “lingering reservation”. People say: “it’s all very clever, but&hellip;”. Yet whatever your view, Hermione Lee’s “perceptive, knowledgeable, stylish and very long” biography is unlikely to be bettered, either as a chronicle of an eventful life or as an “astute and unfailingly clear” commentary on his plays. Having disdained previous attempts to tell his life story, Stoppard handed Lee a “backstage” pass, granting her access to his letters, diaries and friends. With this “sympathetic” portrait, full of “unmatchable detail”, she has repaid him handsomely.</p>
<p>Stoppard was born Tomáš Straussler in 1937, in the Czech town of Zlín, said John Carey in The Sunday Times. His parents, Marta and Eugen, who were Jewish, fled to Singapore when the Nazis invaded. His mother took them to Darjeeling before the Japanese invasion; Eugen was killed trying to escape. In 1945, Marta married an English army major named Kenneth Stoppard: the family moved to England, and Stoppard was sent to boarding school. “He was keen on cricket, joined the Boy Scouts and read voraciously.” After leaving school at 17, he worked in journalism before, aged 23, deciding to become a playwright. His first play, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, an absurdist fantasy about two minor characters from Hamlet, was accepted by Kenneth Tynan at the National Theatre and premiered in 1967 to “ecstatic” reviews. At its equally successful New York premiere, when asked what it was “about”, Stoppard reportedly replied: “It is about to make me a lot of money.”</p>
<p>It certainly did, said Clive Davis in The Times: Stoppard’s wealth is truly awe-inspiring. Unfortunately, Lee dwells rather too much on it, offering “endless” descriptions of his country houses and the seven-figure sums he earned for script-doctoring Steven Spielberg movies. It rather overwhelms the more interesting story of how a “Jewish boy escaped the Holocaust and adopted a new, very English identity”. I disagree, said Jeremy Treglown in the Literary Review. This is a superbly rounded book, “wonderful” on people and places, and good, too, on Stoppard’s “half-dozen most important love affairs” (including one with Sinéad Cusack, Jeremy Irons’s wife). As if being “handsome, funny and a dazzling writer” weren’t enough, Stoppard, now 83, has the “good luck” of being alive to enjoy this “terrific” biography.</p>

<p>Munkey Diaries: 1957-1982 by Jane Birkin</p>
<p>With her “long, choppy fringe” and gap-toothed smile, Jane Birkin was regarded as the epitome of 1960s chic, said Katie Rosseinsky in the London Evening Standard. Yet the figure who emerges from these diaries is “strikingly at odds” with that playful image: she is introspective and given to “self-loathing”. This “icon of French style” was in fact raised in a patrician English family and attended a “Blyton-esque boarding school”, where she was teased for being flat-chested (“I must, I must improve my bust,” she would chant). Leaving school, she became an actress, and met her first husband, “Bond maestro” John Barry, in a London nightclub. But the marriage with the composer was a disaster, and when it broke down, she moved to Paris.</p>
<p>There, on a film set, she met her “Svengali”, the French singer and actor Serge Gainsbourg, said Melanie Reid in The Times. Together, they recorded the “orgasmic” Je t’aime&hellip; moi non plus, and she was showered with film offers. The couple lived a lifestyle “straight out of the Peter Sarstedt song Where Do You Go To (My Lovely)? even down to being friends with Zizi Jeanmaire”. But beneath the gloss, it was “sordid”: they “got horribly drunk, slapped and punched each other in nightclubs, vomited in bed”. Gainsbourg emerges as a “breathtaking pig”, who showered rarely – “his feet stank” – and was horribly “coercive”. But Birkin herself elicits scant sympathy, such is her solipsism and lack of self-awareness. That’s unfair, said Craig Brown in The Mail on Sunday: I found these diaries – addressed to her toy “Munkey” – “wonderfully funny and poignant”. While the journey they chart is rather sad – from innocent schoolgirl lamenting her “disobedience marks” to exploited global sex icon – she remains delightful company throughout, and never loses her “endearing” quality.</p>

<p>Novel of the week</p>
<p>Trio by William Boyd</p>
<p>William Boyd’s “immensely readable” new novel is set in Brighton in 1968, said Francesca Carington in The Daily Telegraph. Three characters are involved in making a film, the “jauntily titled” Emily Bracegirdle’s Extremely Useful Ladder to the Moon. Producer Talbot Kydd is “buffeted” with professional problems while struggling to keep his homosexuality in the closet. Elfrida Wing, the director’s wife, is a once-famous novelist, now blocked and alcoholic. The third is the glamorous but “world-weary” lead actress, Anny Viklund. The mood is a “mix of frolicsome and melancholy” – just the thing for “troubling times”.</p>
<p>When Boyd is good, he is very, very good, but when he’s bad, he’s “downright dispiriting”, said Claire Allfree in the London Evening Standard. And here, sadly, it’s the latter: this novel is “scrappy, unsatisfactory” and “un-atmospheric” for one set in the 1960s. Yes, some of the characters may be a bit stereotyped, said Peter Kemp in The Sunday Times, but this is still an entertaining book. Full of neat phrases and quirkily funny scenes, Trio is a jaunty, “elating read”.</p>

<p>It was a concert, but not as we know it. The first four rows were empty. The 300 people in the 1,900-capacity hall were so socially distanced that it was positively unsociable. We all wore masks, and nipping off to the bar or the toilet was not allowed once the hour-long show started. Hats off, then, not only to the Barbican staff for making this ultra-safe event happen with good cheer and good grace, but also to Neil Hannon of the Divine Comedy for refusing to let the sight of so many empty seats get him down. “Hey, it’s a gig!” he enthused, before leading his five-piece band through a greatest hits set (this was not the time to try anything clever) that found

<h3 id="sophia-loren-i-never-had-a-relationship-with-my-father">&ldquo;Sophia Loren: ‘I never had a relationship with my father’&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.irishtimes.com/image-creator/?id=1.4388196&amp;origw=1280" alt="img">
More than a decade after her last film, Sophia Loren has returned to acting for a new collaboration with her son Edoardo Ponti. He’s a film-maker who ‘knows every inch of my face, my heart, my soul’</p>
<p>Remember when Elizabeth Taylor “invented” the celebrity perfume with a fragrance named Passion in 1987? Remember when Nigella Lawson made eating and cooking look sexy in the 1990s? Remember when Victoria Beckham launched her successful DVB eyewear line in 2013?</p>
<p>Well, Sophia Loren did it first. The Napoli FC-supporting Oscar winner beat Liz to the punch with her own eponymous perfume in 1982. She launched an eyewear brand as long ago as 1980. And Gwyneth and Nigella were still toddling when Loren wrote Eat With Me, a “gastronomic autobiography” featuring the star straddling pâté and petting pheasants.</p>
<p>The best part? The woman who famously said “Everything you see I owe to spaghetti” doesn’t even pretend to have made the Aubergine Mayonnaise Crostini. That task fell to her “faithful secretary”.</p>
<p>Joan Collins (L) and Sophia Loren</p>
<p>Loren dismisses the idea that she was any kind of pioneer with these celebrity innovations.</p>
<p>“I love cooking and the aroma of cooking in the house and I also love the scent of good perfume, so I pursued two of my favourite hobbies.”</p>
<p>Eat With Me is characterised by glamorous photo shoots, biographical digressions, and such contemporaneous points of etiquette as urging smokers to consider other diners before blazing up, Loren also notes that when the occasion and guests are special enough she herself will prepare a dish “with my own hands”. That remains the case.</p>
<p>“I don’t write recipes so much but I do still cook,” she says. “Not as much as I used to but when my sons come home for Christmas with their families I like to cook for them.”</p>
<p>Playing the role of Madame Rosa has been one of the most beautiful and rewarding experiences of my life</p>
<p>If there is one thing we can be sure of in this uncertain world, it’s this: Sophia Loren may not have cooked the Aubergine Mayonnaise Crostini but she is a movie star. Ageism shall not weary her. Nobody sniggered when, aged 72, she offered to do a striptease should S S C Napoli win Serie B, Italian football&rsquo;s second division.</p>
<p>At 86, she represents, in fact, the last of Hollywood’s Golden Age. She is the only living actor to feature in a list of the greatest stars of Classic Hollywood as compiled by the American Film Institute at the turn-of-the-millenium. Almost seven decades have passed since she made her screen debut in the 1951 comedy, Yes, Yes… It’s Him!.</p>
<p>The movie business, she says, has changed in that time. And a good thing too. “There are more opportunities for more people of all genders and ethnicities,” she says. “Cinema is a reflection of society, all voices need to be heard, a great deal is starting to happen in that direction which is incredibly important. It certainly wasn’t the case when I began.”</p>
<p>Loren has not made a feature film since her grand entrance in 2009’s Nine, the star-studded musical-comedy inspired by Federico Fellini 8½, and featuring relative newcomer Daniel Day Lewis as Fellini ersatz. “I love Daniel Day Lewis,” says Loren. “I don’t know if he qualifies as a young actor, but he certainly is young to me and he is fabulous. A true artist.”</p>
<p>She’s returning to the silver screen – and from semi-retirement – for The Life Ahead, a second major movie version of Romain Gary’s novel The Life Before Us. It was previously adapted by Israeli director Moshé Mizrahi as Madame Rosa in 1977 and starred Simone Signoret.</p>
<p>“I saw the film when it came out in the 1970s and not since then unfortunately,” she says. “But I love and admire Simone Signoret a great deal. She is a spectacular actress. Our version was based on the famous book.”</p>

<p>The Life Ahead casts Loren Madame Rosa, an ailing Holocaust survivor living in the Italian coastal town of Bari, who forms a special friendship with Momo, a 12-year-old Senegalese immigrant boy.</p>
<p>“She is tough, she is vulnerable, she is irreverent, she is a survivor,” says Loren. “Playing the role of Madame Rosa has been one of the most beautiful and rewarding experiences of my life. Every film, every character demands something different of you. What made this character unusual were her complexities, she had so many emotional colours, sometimes opposite ones in the same scene. And then her illness was key to get right. We worked hard to make sure that all aspects of her person and illness were as authentic and realistic as possible.”</p>
<p>Following on from a 2013 adaptation of Jean Cocteau’s monodrama, The Human Voice, the 2002 melodrama, Between Strangers, The Life Ahead marks the third collaboration between Loren’s director son Edoardo Ponti. He’s a film-maker who “&hellip;knows every inch of my face, my heart, my soul”, she says.</p>
<p>“Working with my son is one of the joys of my life. We understand each other so deeply, we expect a lot from each other, we inspire each other. I feel with him I can truly work in an environment that allows me to be creatively free and daring. The collaboration between actor and director is key. We are partners, everything flows from that partnership. The fact that my director was also my son rendered the process even deeper and more fulfilling.”</p>

<p>Loren is almost as enthusiastic about the 10-hour days she worked during production. Every shoot is tough but if you love something as much as I love acting and telling stories then time flies. You feel the fatigue at night going to bed but when you wake up the next morning, you’re ready to tackle another day with the same enthusiasm. I feel lucky to be able to do what I do.”</p>
<p>Loren was 25 and at the height of her fame in 1960 when she filmed The Millionairess. During the shoot, her co-star, Peter Sellers, left his wife and children for her, despite the fact that she had dismissed his advances as a “delusional fantasy”. She was also robbed. Three sets of diamonds, emeralds and rubies were listed among the valuables stolen from her room. That’s quite a leap from her origins.</p>
<p>“Hunger was the major theme of my childhood,” she once wrote. “It would take a book to describe it,” she says. Sure enough, her autobiography recalls that her mother begged in the streets during wartime and that Loren had never before seen a chocolate bar when an American soldier gifted her with one.</p>
<p>Loren was born Sofia Villani Scicolone in 1934 in Rome, to Romilda, a piano teacher, and Riccardo Scicolone, a construction engineer of noble descent. In theory, Loren was bestowed with the title Marchioness of Licata Scicolone Murillo. But her father abandoned the family, leaving Loren to grow up in grinding poverty with her grandparents in Naples. She met her father only three times, aged five, aged 17, and on his deathbed in 1976.</p>
<p>“I never had a relationship with my father,” says Loren. “I wish he would have been a different person, a different father and different companion for my mother but he was who he was and you don’t get to choose your parents. I was lucky though to have a great mother who loved both me and my sister with all her heart.”</p>
<p>Carlo showed me that I could make my dreams come true. We were partners in love, in family and in work. I don’t want to think of my life without him in it</p>
<p>In 1950, aged 15, she entered the Miss Italia 1950 beauty pageant and was named Miss Elegance. Two years later, she enrolled in the national film school and appeared as an extra in Mervyn LeRoy’s Quo Vadis. In her 2015 memoir, Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow: My Life, she recalls being dismissed from an early screen test because “Her face is too short, her mouth is too big, and her nose is too long.” But Hollywood felt differently and swiftly embraced her as an exotic screen talent. She remains, rather modestly, unsure why she made it where other European actors floundered.</p>
<p>“Maybe that I learnt English very early on so that I could act in another language that wasn’t my own?” she says. “Learning languages is key if you want to act in countries other than your own.”</p>

<p>By 1960, she was an international film star, propelled by a five-picture deal at Paramount Pictures and a first Academy Award win for Best Actress for her work on Vittorio De Sica’s Two Women. She was too nervous to attend the ceremony, feeling certain that she would lose out to an American competitor and citing “fear of fainting”.</p>
<p>“It’s not that I was intimidated,” she says. “It was so amazing that I had even been nominated. I just never expected that I could win. Bear in mind that no actress had ever won with a foreign language film before. It was so incredible to be celebrated by your peers, by fellow actors that I revered and admired so much.”</p>
<p>Despite a brief and unconsummated dalliance with Cary Grant, who, she says, was “&hellip;a delightful person, funny, elegant and a dear friend”, she was already involved with the Italian producer Carlo Ponti when Grant called with news of her Oscar triumph.</p>
<p>The couple were married in 1957 but were forced by Italy’s then draconian divorce laws to seek a divorce in 1963 or else face charges for bigamy. Seeking refuge in France they were legally remarried in 1966 and remained together until Ponti’s death in 2007. He had an enormous influence on her career, advising her in everything from her wardrobe to script choices.</p>

<p>“What Carlo gave me were the tools to believe in myself,” says Loren. “He showed me that I could make my dreams come true. We were partners in love, in family and in work. I don’t want to think of my life without him in it.”</p>
<p>Her career hasn’t all been plain sailing. She turned down the Alexis Carrington role in Dynasty. Few viewers remember the 1974 remake of Brief Encounter or the 1974 mega-flop Man of La Mancha. Nobody describes Prêt-à-Porter as their favourite Robert Altman film or Nine as Rob Marshall’s finest hour. Still, Loren has blazed up the screen with Clark Gable, Marcello Mastroianni, Paul Newman, Gregory Peck, Richard Burton, and Marlon Brando. She inspired Peter Sarstedt’s global hit, Where Do You Go To (My Lovely)? And to date, she has won a Grammy, five Golden Globes (including the Cecil B. DeMille Award), a BAFTA, the Volpi Cup for Best Actress at the Venice Film Festival and Best Actress Award at the Cannes Film Festival.</p>
<p>“Every recognition marks a specific moment in my life, in my career,” she says. “These awards are truly all special because the memories they created are indelible and mean a great deal to me. Nothing happens quickly. Nothing happens overnight. I still marvel at the fact that I get to do the job that I do, I love it so much. I take nothing for granted.”</p>
<p>In 2018, a collective of 100 French women – including film star Catherine Deneuve – responded to the Me Too movement with an open letter defending men’s “freedom to pester” women. Loren, who worked with Harvey Weinstein on Nine, is having none of it.</p>
<p>“I am so proud of the women who stood up to such horrible and unacceptable mistreatment,” she says. “It is inadmissible and has been going on for way too long. My two granddaughters will be growing up in a better world thanks to the courage of these women, their determination and their strength; I admire and respect them deeply.”</p>
<p>The Life Ahead is on Netflix from November 13th

<h3 id="almodóvar-y-otros-directores-que-se-pasaron-al-corto">&ldquo;Almodóvar y otros directores que se pasaron al corto&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://elcultural.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/a-26-e1603263586640.jpg" alt="img">
“Los cortos no son inferiores a los largometrajes, simplemente son diferentes. Los cortos ofrecen libertad a los realizadores. Lo atractivo es que no tienes tanta responsabilidad en aspectos como la narrativa o el argumento. Pueden parecerse más a un retrato o a un poema”. Estas palabras de la directora neozelandesa Jane Campion, autora de filmes como El piano (1993) y Bright Star (2009) y de una serie de televisión tan misteriosa y atmosférica como Top of the Lake, reflejan las posibilidades artísticas de un formato que nunca ha contado con el prestigio que merecía (algo que no ocurre con el relato dentro de la literatura). Las razones son variadas y complejas, desde la dificultad que siempre han tenido para conseguir un retorno económico hasta la escasa costumbre del espectador a dejarse llevar por estas miniaturas. De manera que un cineasta suele olvidarse del cortometraje una vez que han estrenado un par que le permite llamar la atención en algún festival y convencer a algún productor para que les financie su primera película.</p>
<p>En cualquier caso, grandes directores han regresado al cortometraje cuando contaban ya con una larga trayectoria para profundizar en sus posibilidades. El último de ellos, un Pedro Almodóvar que si bien es cierto que ya había entregado un hilarante trabajo como La concejala antropófaga en 2009, ahora se supera con el estreno en cines (todo un hito) de La voz humana, un genial corto protagonizado por Tilda Swinton en el que el director manchego rueda por primera vez en el idioma de Shakespeare.</p>
<p>Repasamos algunos de esos cortometrajes que grandes directores rodaron cuando ya estaban asentados en la industria.</p>
<p>Publicidad</p>
<p>La voz humana (2020), de Pedro Almodóvar. 30 min.</p>
<p>Esta adaptación de la obra de Jean Cocteau, un monólogo de un solo acto protagonizado por una mujer abandonada por su amante, debía funcionar como un campo de pruebas para que Pedro Almodóvar afrontara su primer largometraje en inglés: la traslación a imágenes de cinco relatos de Lucia Berlín incluidos en Manual para mujeres de la limpieza. La pandemia, sin embargo, ha provocado que el director tenga que aparcar este proyecto (su próximo filme, que empezará a rodar a principios de 2021, será Madres paralelas, un drama protagonizado por Penélope Cruz y rodado en español). La voz humana, en cualquier caso, es algo más que una anécdota o una tentativa, como demuestra el hecho de que Avalon se haya decidido a estrenarlo en cines con un precio reducido.</p>
<p>El cortometraje tiene como gran protagonista a la actriz Tilda Swinton, que interpreta a esa mujer despechada que espera ansiosa noticias de su ex amante. Almodóvar se apropia con libertad del texto de Cocteau y monta un dispositivo metacinematográfico, en el que el apartamento desde el que transcurre la acción es realmente un decorado situado en mitad de una nave. De manera que el monólogo no solo se manifiesta como una lección moral sobre el deseo sino que es también una reflexión sobre el trabajo interpretativo de la actriz y sobre la magia del cine, gracias sobre todo al trabajo en la iluminación y la fotografía de José Luis Alcaine.</p>
<p>La naturalidad dentro del registro almodovariano y el magnetismo con el que se desempeña Swinton en cada uno de los planos demuestra la filiación del manchego a un estilo de impacto universal que ya no requiere un punto de partida castizo (aunque no desaparezca del todo). Además, el filme sigue ahondando en la depuración formal que ya suponía Dolor y gloria. En cualquier caso, La voz humana mantiene constantes del cine del director, como la habitual paleta de colores o el amor por los personajes femeninos, y descorcha en un final tan impactante como mágico.</p>
<p>What Did Jack Do? (2020), de David Lynch. 17 min.</p>
<p>Probablemente sea David Lynch el director que mejor ha transmitido al espectador la sensación de estar soñando. Su último trabajo, What Did you Do?, que se estrenó este mismo año en Netflix, profundizaba en esta vía con la historia de un detective, interpretado por el propio Lynch, que interroga a un mono sobre un asesinato. Con una imagen en blanco y negro sometida artificialmente a la degradación propia del celuloide y un diseño de producción que nos retratae al cine negro clásico y que van incluso algo más allá, apuntando al expresionismo alemán, el corto se construye en torno a una surrealista conversación plagada de frases hechas. En palabras del crítico Carlos Reviriego, “podemos seguir su lógica tal y como construimos la lógica de los sueños cuando los estamos soñando, pero que parecen perderla por completo cuando los recordamos en la vigilia. Es algo realmente complejo de conseguir que sin embargo el maestro Lynch hace con toda naturalidad y sin complejo alguno”.</p>
<p>The Fall (2019), de Jonathan Glazer. 7 min.</p>
<p>La noche del 27 de octubre de 2019, los telespectadores británicos que esperaban desde la comodidad de su sofá pasar un buen rato con el programa de monólogos Live at the Apollo se enfrentaron a una sorpresa bastante espeluznante. Sin previo aviso, la segunda cadena de la BBC emitió el corto The Fall, de Jonathan Glazer -autor de Sexy Beast (2000) y Under the Skin (2013)-, una ficción de tintes pesadillescos que creó cierto caos y un gran revuelo. El filme, del que es mejor desvelar poco, sigue a una turba de personas enmascaradas que captura a un pobre hombre y, después de hacerse una especie de selfie con él como si fuera una pieza de caza, le pone una soga al cuello y lo lanza por un pozo. Inspirado por El sueño de la razón produce monstruos, de Francisco de Goya, por Bertolt Brecht e incluso por la familia Trump, este corto atmosférico, con un espectacular diseño de sonido y la inquietante música de Mica Levi, no ofrece respuestas pero sí la sensación de que Glazer nos quiere decir algo sobre nuestro tiempo.</p>
<p>Hotel Chevalier (2007), de Wes Anderson. 13 min.</p>
<p>Aunque en origen este corto de Wes Anderson no iba a tener relación con Viaje a Darjeeling, poco antes de empezar a rodarlo el director se dio cuenta de que el personaje interpretado por Jason Schwartzman guardaba muchas similitudes con uno de los protagonistas de su quinta película y decidió convertirlo en una especie de prólogo de la misma. La enigmática historia de Hotel Chevalier nos cuenta el encuentro en una habitación de hotel de París de un hombre (el mencionado Schwartzman) y su ex amante (Natalie Portman) al son de Where Do You Go To My Lovely, de Peter Sarstedt. Un filme con las marcas de estilo de Anderson (tales como los planos simétricos y los travellings laterales) en el que los personajes nos dejan atisbar con apenas unas líneas de diálogo y sutiles detalles todas las complejidades de su relación. Una pequeña joya.</p>
<p>I’m Here (2010), de Spike Jonze. 29 min.</p>
<p>El inclasificable Spike Jonze, director de filmes como Cómo ser John Malkovich (1999), Adaptation. El ladrón de orquídeas (2002) o Her (2013), no ha tenido miedo a lo largo de su carrera de probar distintos medios y formatos. Así, se encuentra detrás de una gamberrada como Jackass y de algunos de los mejores videos musicales de la historia, desde el Buddy Holly de Wezzer al Weapon of Choice de Fat Boy Slim. También ha rodado un buen número de anuncios (espectacular el titulado Welcome Home, para Apple) y un puñado de cortometrajes entre los que destaca I’m Here. Se trata de una peculiar historia de amor entre dos robots en un mundo muy similar al nuestro en que los autómatas conviven con normalidad con los humanos. Sheldon, el protagonista al que da vida Andrew Garlfield, es un ayudante de biblioteca que lleva en Los Ángeles una vida anodina y rutinaria. De repente, un día tiene un encuentro que le abre los ojos a un mundo de creatividad y de amor. Un filme en apariencia tierno con una lectura algo tétrica sobre el amor incondicional.</p>
<p>Snow Steam Iron (2017), de Zack Snyder. 4 min.</p>
<p>Zach Snyder, intenso y grandilocuente director de producciones superheroicas como El hombre de acero y Batman v Superman, estrenó en 2017 este cortometraje de apenas 4 minutos. Rodado completamente con un iPhone, con la colaboración de amigos y sin presupuesto, se trata de un thriller con solventes secuencias de acción que demuestran las posibilidades de la cámara del teléfono de Apple y en el que Snyder consigue mantener una apuesta visual muy potente que ya es marca de la casa. La nieve cae suavemente sobre Nueva York, los vapores envuelven de pesadilla las estrellas callejuelas de la ciudad y una mujer acomete su particular venganza.</p>
<p>Swimmer (2012), de Lynn Ramsey. 17 min.</p>
<p>Ganador de un premio BAFTA al mejor cortometraje, este corto dirigido por Lynn Ramsey después del estreno de Tenemos que hablar de Kevin (2011) nos introduce en la cabeza de un nadador (Tom Little) que atraviesa ríos rurales y aguas urbanas mientras que en el interior de su cabeza deja que la imaginación vuele. Con un gran diseño de producción, el cortometraje destila un poderoso blanco y negro y su banda sonora se construye con fragmentos de diálogo de viejas películas y canciones antiguás, además de sugerentes efectos de sonido. Todo ello construye un estilizado y sobrecogedor poema sobre la belleza del cuerpo humano en movimiento y sobre el reverso oscuro de la práctica deportiva.

<p><img src="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/obituaries/2020/07/17/TELEMMGLPICT000235251648_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqXXJnULV8Fx6naLiD5tbdC8zqDp6uWZFEexBpKcTsNXA.jpeg?impolicy=logo-overlay" alt="img">
Born on April 29 1924 in Paris, Renée Marcelle Jeanmaire was the only child of Swiss parents, and began as petit rat in the Paris Opera Ballet School at nine, alongside Petit. It was the start of a 78-year relationship, professional and private, that ended only on his death in 2011.</p>
<p>She joined the august ballet company on the eve of war, when she was only 15, taken under the wing of the brilliant young ballerina Yvette Chauviré. But the younger dancer recognised that she would never be the classical sylph epitomised by Chauviré, and she and Petit quit the Paris Opera Ballet in 1944 when both were just 20.</p>
<p>Zizi Jeanmaire joined the Ballets Russes follow-up companies of Colonel de Basil, while Petit set up his own company, Les Ballets des Champs-Elysées, which rapidly became the most talked-about company in Western Europe: modern, sexy and up to date, and starring the remarkable and unorthodox dancers, Renée Jeanmaire and Jean Babilée.

Singer-songwriter who topped the charts in 1969 with Where Do You Go to (My Lovely)</p>
<p>For many weeks in the spring and summer of 1969, the names of Zizi Jeanmaire, the Aga Khan and Juan-les-Pins reverberated mellifluously around the British and international pop scene. They appeared in the lyrics of the chart-topping Where Do You Go to (My Lovely), written and sung by Peter Sarstedt, who has died aged 75.</p>
<p>Composed in waltz time, bookended by generic French-flavoured accordion phrases and with echoes of francophone chansonniers such as Georges Brassens and Jacques Brel, the song told the story of one Marie Claire, who had risen from the “back streets of Naples” to join the Mediterranean jet set. When the similarity of this back-story to that of Sophia Loren was pointed out, Sarstedt was quick to state: “I really wasn’t thinking of anyone specific.”</p>
<p>He was born in Delhi, one of six children of English expatriates, Albert and Coral Sarstedt. Albert was an accountant who managed a tea plantation in the Darjeeling region of West Bengal. Following his death in 1954, the family moved to south London.</p>
<p>The Sarstedts were a musical family and Peter, his older brother, Richard, and younger siblings, Clive and Lorraine, all learned the guitar. This was the era of skiffle, and the three brothers joined a group, the Fabulous Five. They played at church halls and coffee bars around the Croydon area before metamorphosing into a beat group, the Saints, with Richard Sarstedt as the featured singer. He was offered a recording contract in 1960, and after a change of name to Eden Kane, scored a No 1 hit with Well I Ask You the following year.</p>

<p>Peter played bass guitar in Eden Kane’s backing group until, in 1965, his brother decided to move to Australia. Peter emigrated briefly to Copenhagen, where he began to write songs in a contemporary folk vein. Returning to London, he began a recording career as Peter Lincoln before reverting to his real name. In 1968 he signed to the United Artists label, but his first single, I Am a Cathedral, was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>He next came up with Where Do You Go to (My Lovely). Sarstedt later explained that he was following a trend for meaningful songs of more than three minutes’ duration: “I wanted to write a long extended piece because I was working in folk clubs and universities.”</p>
<p>When Sarstedt and the producer Ray Singer presented the record company with the completed track, the response was unpromising: the song was too long, it featured only three instruments, including an accordion, and no drums. Eventually, United Artists relented after cutting one verse which included the line “your body is firm and inviting”. Within a few weeks of its release, Where Do You Go to (My Lovely) had topped the charts and Sarstedt’s bushy hair and Zapata moustache were regularly featured on Top of the Pops.</p>
<p>The song stayed at No 1 for four weeks before making way for Marvin Gaye’s I Heard It Through the Grapevine. Where Do You Go to (My Lovely) went on to top the charts throughout most of Europe as well as Australia and Japan, but its cosmopolitanism failed to excite record buyers in the US, where it sold poorly.</p>
<p>Although it won the Ivor Novello award for best song of 1969 (shared with Space Oddity by David Bowie), Where Do You Go to (My Lovely) divided listeners at the time and has done ever since, with some finding it pretentious, if not preposterous. It inspired parodies by Roger McGough, John Otway and the Flight of the Conchords. On the other hand, the director Wes Anderson included it on the soundtrack of two films, Hotel Chevalier (2007) and The Darjeeling Limited (2012), and the British group Right Said Fred, made a comparatively respectful cover version in 2006. Sarstedt composed a follow up for his 1997 album England’s Lane. The Last of the Breed (Lovely 2) described Marie Claire 20 years on and living in a London of Claridge’s, Harrods and John Galliano.</p>
<p>The follow-up single, Frozen Orange Juice, was a Top 10 hit later in 1969, but further records were not commercially successful, although Sarstedt’s compositions continued to find admirers: one reviewer described the song Beirut as “an entire novel of Eric Ambler complexities in three minutes”.</p>
<p>From the 1970s until his retirement in 2010 when he was diagnosed with the progressive supranuclear palsy that led to his death, Sarstedt recorded more than a dozen albums and performed frequently. Among the albums was a 1973 collaboration with his brothers, Worlds Apart Together. Using the name Robin Sarstedt, his younger brother Clive had his own hit record with My Resistance Is Low in 1976, making the Sarstedts the first family with three siblings to achieve separate chart success. For some years, Peter Sarstedt was a mainstay of the Solid Silver 60s touring show alongside other veterans of the era.</p>
<p>Sarstedt was twice married and had two children, Anna and Daniel.</p>

<h3 id="she-was-paris-rip-zizi-jeanmaire-1924-2020">&ldquo;&lsquo;She was Paris&rsquo;: RIP Zizi Jeanmaire (1924-2020)&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://theartsdesk.com/sites/default/files/favicon.ico" alt="img">
&ldquo;You talk like Marlene Dietrich, you dance like Zizi Jeanmaire, your clothes are all made by Balmain, and there’s diamonds and pearls in your hair…&rdquo; . Peter Sarstedt may have been a one-hit wonder, but his 1969 pop song, &ldquo;Where do you go to (my lovely)?&rdquo; passed into British popular culture in a flash, even if many of its chic references were lost on future generations. Zizi Jeanmaire, who died last Friday aged 96, personified the Paris of the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s, and beyond.</p>
<p>In her cabaret shows, the pixie-ish little figure with boy-cut black hair and fabulous legs would twerk with gigantic pink ostrich fans, and sing worldly songs about how love is merde. Her haircut, radical in 1949, was copied around the world, and Yves St Laurent took her as his muse for the theatrical side of his fashion. The Zizi style, all legs, laughter and feathers, inspired album covers and posters in an unmistakable, utterly Parisian iconography.</p>
<p>But Jeanmaire was also one of the 20th century’s game-changing ballerinas, epitomising the new postwar wave of modern French ballet. sought out by Rudolf Nureyev and Mikhail Baryshnikov, among others, dancing the hip young ballets of her husband, the choreographer Roland Petit, in his explosively successful companies Les Ballets des Champs-Elysées and the Ballet de Paris.</p>
<p>Two of the most memorable were his iconoclastic and sexy Carmen, premiered in London in 1949 – which made both his and Jeanmaire’s names as the ballet couple of the era (the British choreographer Frederick Ashton immediately said he felt old-fashioned) – and the brooding Forties melodrama of Le Jeune homme et la mort. (The pair pictured, above, in the film of Petit&rsquo;s Carmen)</p>
<p>But Jeanmaire wanted to be different, and taught herself to sing so as to scoop the lead in Petit&rsquo;s 1951 musical-comedy ballet, La Croqueuse de diamants (&ldquo;I eat diamonds&rdquo;). From then on she grew as famous for her gravelly singing as for her dancing. She would record a dozen or more albums, and starred in Petit&rsquo;s choreography for Irma la Douce, Folies-Bergère and Black Tights, celebrated on Broadway as well as in the great boîtes de nuit. Petit invented a new kind of revue for her in the Casino de Paris, sophisticatedly saucy, opulently costumed, with the benefit of France&rsquo;s superb songwriters and musicians. Saint Laurent designed countless extravagant costumes for her, usually a chic and classy bodysuit with a mad outburst of feathers framing her celebrated &ldquo;truc&rdquo; (thingamajig).</p>
<p>Born in 1924, Renée Jeanmaire (Zizi was her childhood nickname) and Roland Petit were adventurous soulmates who burst out of the junior ranks of the Paris Opera Ballet aged 18 in German-occupied Paris. At first they were just friends, but Jeanmaire became increasingly jealous of Petit’s independence and his many lovers, who included Margot Fonteyn. Finally, in 1948 she gave Petit an ultimatum: make me a ballet or I leave. She got the ballet, Carmen, and world fame overnight, and after some stormy years she got the man. They married in 1954, had a daughter, Valentine, and remained fierily devoted to each other until Petit’s death in 2011, aged 87.</p>
<p>In 1998 I interviewed Zizi Jeanmaire in Geneva, Switzerland, where the Petits had just moved to after decades in France. Fashions in dance had moved on, and Petit had had to leave his Ballet de Marseille after 26 years. &ldquo;He told me, I’ve had enough, I’ll go, we leave France. So I said, OK.&rdquo; Zizi was 74, but still touring her own cabaret show.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you always do what your husband says?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; she said. Always saying yes to him would turn out to be the brilliant thing to do – for both of them.</p>
<p>The couple were renting while they searched for a permanent apartment, and all the souvenirs of her astonishingly florid (and astonishingly long) career were still packed in storage. We sat in the spartan space without a pink feather in sight and had tea. It would be nice to go back to London, she said, rather wistfully. London was where she was discovered, almost 50 years earlier.</p>
<p>I was attracted by him, by his taste. Maybe he did a bit of Pygmalion on me but I was looking for that</p>
<p>When you were nine, and at the Paris Opéra Ballet school, what did you dream of being?</p>
<p>What happened to me in London! That was my dream. I was doing my classes to be a classical ballerina, and I had a big example in front of me, and it was marvellous to arrive at that marvellous theatre, so big, with gold everywhere, and I dreamed of being a great dancer.</p>
<p>I first came to England with the Colonel de Basil company, which had all the Diaghilev repertory. We toured into London, it was 1946 or 47, just after the war. And I was prima ballerina with the company. We did Les Sylphides – that was not my cup of tea, it&rsquo;s beautiful ballet but not my type, pas tout à fait mon emploi. And Le fils prodigue, and I don’t know, many many things.</p>
<p>And finally I left the company because I was not very happy there. I went back to Paris and joined my husband, who was doing the Ballets de Paris de Roland Petit, and we began a season in France. And Margot Fonteyn came to dance Les Demoiselles de la nuit. And the second year, I asked my husband – who was not my husband at that time – to do me a big production. And finally he decided to do Carmen. And I was so happy. But scared, at the same time.</p>
<p>He said in a TV documentary that you weren’t his first choice.</p>
<p>No, I was not&hellip; No [contradicts herself], I was his first choice, he had no choice, because I wanted to have a ballet or I was leaving.</p>
<p>Which classic roles did you like?</p>
<p>I didn’t care really, what I wanted was a creation for me. I did Coppélia, La Fille mal gardée, Sylphides &hellip; ouf!&hellip; La Belle au bois dormant. But no, I wanted to have a creation.</p>
<p>Who were your idols as a child?</p>
<p>I loved very much then a beautiful dancer called Yvette Chauviré. She was my ‘petite mère’ (an older girl who would mentor a younger one), wonderful with me. She helped me and took me to her teacher, a marvellous man called Boris Kniaseff.</p>
<p>You have a very different image from Chauviré, she was the classical ballerina, you were so different.</p>
<p>What do you mean by classical? I don’t think my husband is something other than classical.</p>
<p>No, but his work is more about real emotions of people, like Kenneth MacMillan.</p>
<p>You mean, that MacMillan copied him, because he did it much before MacMillan. My god, he began in ’40&hellip; oh, la la.</p>
<p>I mean, classical ballets are about high, aristocratic emotions; Petit&rsquo;s works are about real people.</p>
<p>But that is a little bit fast. He&rsquo;s in the same lineage of Petipa, and he worked with Kochno, who came from Diaghilev, and so he is the continuity of the Ballets Russes. But with new things – in my opinion. When he was 18 he had created so many new things already, so when he arrived in London it was an évênement. Overnight it was in all the newspapers, from London to Paris and then New York, we were six months on Broadway with ballets. That never happened before&hellip;</p>
<p>So you weren&rsquo;t actually an iconoclast?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Yet you seemed to be, somehow .</p>
<p>Mmmm. It&rsquo;s what I did. It depends what you do in your life, the way you do it. All my life I had the chance to have people, marvellous people around me, like&hellip; my husband, of course, Yves Saint Laurent, Clavé who did my costume for Carmen. I had always beautiful costumes. And Saint Laurent did for me, for 30 years, my costumes.</p>
<p>I was jealous of Fonteyn, because I loved him but he was taking a lot of care of her</p>
<p>Did you never wear a tutu?</p>
<p>No. Tutu c’est très beau, I love it, but I don’t think my destination was that kind of thing. [She smiles broadly.]</p>
<p>Did Carmen stereotype you?</p>
<p>Yes. if you discover finally (she snaps her fingers)… if you have the chance to find someone who can take something out of you or your personality, when you find that, then after of course you follow in that line.</p>
<p>When Fonteyn came on the scene, you have said he and she flirted a lot, you were jealous.</p>
<p>Well, I was jealous because I loved him already, but he was taking a lot of care of her, and she liked him very much. She came to do the first season, as I told you, so of course&hellip; it&rsquo;s for that that afterwards I told him, make me a ballet. Otherwise, I said, I will go. He said, ok ok, I will see what I can do. When he was 18, I loved what he did, and when we had discussions at the Opéra, he said to me, oh, you must have a creation. You can do all the ballets you want, because you have the technique, but the best thing in life is to have a creation.</p>
<p>Without him, what sort of career would you have had?</p>
<p>I was completely trained for classical, for Giselle, for Lac.</p>
<p>Did you do them?</p>
<p>No, because I left the Opera when I was 19, and he left six months after me, and he did his career. And I went to Monte Carlo to the Ballets de Monte Carlo.</p>
<p>That was brave. Why?</p>
<p>I wanted to try something else. I loved the Opéra, and I was very lucky to be there to learn, but at 18 I felt I wanted to do something else.</p>
<p>You didn’t dream of being Odette.</p>
<p>No, not really.</p>
<p>I can’t see you as Odette, too much fire.</p>
<p>But you have to have fire to do Odette. I am sorry, but it is not easy to do. Even to be a swan, you have to have fire inside. You have to have beautiful arms&hellip; look at Makarova, she did it beautifully and with fire. She wasn&rsquo;t evanouissante (wispy, faint).</p>
<p>How much like Carmen are you? She says, &ldquo;l’amour est un oiseau rebelle&rdquo;, but you have been faithful for so long.</p>
<p>[She laughs.] No, it&rsquo;s more about temperament. I am not romantique – well, everybody is romantic inside – but my temperament is bouillante (boiling hot). And Carmen is a story of passion. In my nature I am not romantic either of approach or feelings. To do the big ballets, Giselle, Lac, I can see the attraction. Because what matters is to have beautiful things to dance. But it was not my desire.</p>
<p>What about the idea of a ballerina doing cabaret? It’s not that pure, high culture you’re trained for.</p>
<p>It depends how you think. It&rsquo;s not always &ldquo;pure, high&rdquo;. Like sometimes people do ballet, and think they are very important, but it doesn’t mean anything. It depends how the work is made. In Paris they said, oh la la, a classical choreographer who is doing musicals&hellip; but it depends how you do it. In America, Balanchine did musicals, Robbins did musicals – nobody said, oh they&rsquo;re just doing shows.</p>
<p>And Frederick Ashton did revues. Was crossing over hard on your body?</p>
<p>I had a few accidents. I would go from high heels to ballet shoes in a musical, that was hard. I had a tendon injury, I was off for a year and a half. The doctor didn’t think I could dance again, but I wanted to and I did. [She was in her forties then.]</p>
<p>You have to have guts to go on stage, whatever you are doing.</p>
<p>La Croqueuse de diamants, for instance, I did in Paris and New York; I came on stage and sang for the first time.</p>
<p>Is performing everything to you? Is there life without performing?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult to think of it. I stopped dancing on toe, not a long time ago, but one day I said, I stop, I now do just musicals.</p>
<p>[The phone keeps ringing, this time it is Carla Fracci on the line. Jeanmaire explains to me after the call.]</p>
<p>I had a Petit number with a chair and two partners. it was suggested by Fred Astaire for me, something he did with his sister on Broadway. One table, two chairs, and we danced on them. So my husband did this number for me with Luigi Bonino and it was a great success, it was a very good number. And Fracci, who is doing a television film in Italy now, asked if she could do this number, and it&rsquo;s very good&hellip;. so she was calling, and was so nice. She&rsquo;s wonderful. My husband did a creation for her two or three years ago, Cheri, with Massimo Murru.</p>
<p>Why do ballerinas love your husband&rsquo;s work so much?</p>
<p>Because he does big roles. You can play them, express yourself.</p>
<p>You must think yourself so lucky to have found him, such a professional and personal fit.</p>
<p>Yes, it’s true. I was attracted by him, by his taste, by his way of choosing people, painters, musicians, I like it when he takes a risk. Maybe he did a bit of Pygmalion on me. But I was looking for that, I was attracted by what he was doing, and my taste was for that.</p>
<p>Who were your favourites, the dancers you most admired and your friends?</p>
<p>Oh la la la&hellip; Moi, j’adore&hellip; but I like them because they are good dancers. For instance, I love Fracci, I love Altynai Asylmuratova - she is a wonderful dancer - I loved Baryshnikov, he was magnificent; Nicolas Le Riche, Murru. Whatever appeared to me and put me in extase. (Baryshnikov and Jeanmaire, below right, in the 1980 film of Petit&rsquo;s Carmen)</p>
<p>Do you watch much dance for pleasure?</p>
<p>I’ll watch when I like it.</p>
<p>Modern?</p>
<p>Yes, but I am not open to everything&hellip; I can watch Martha Graham.</p>
<p>Pina Bausch?</p>
<p>Yes, of course, she has talent.</p>
<p>Merce Cunningham?</p>
<p>Mmmm&hellip;. yah.</p>
<p>Too abstract?</p>
<p>No. Abstraction doesn&rsquo;t put me off. But I need some sensation, and a beautiful one. Not ugly. J’aime que ça me parle.</p>
<p>Your husband has been making his career at a time when the trend was increasingly for modern work – has he been concerned?</p>
<p>No, not all.</p>
<p>In Britain that&rsquo;s the impression.</p>
<p>It’s because he hasn’t been performed in England. When he had the company, he couldn’t go to England because they couldn’t give the money, at all. You can’t afford by yourself to bring a company of 50 years. For 25 years it is now impossible. Japanese can give money, the Italians, the Germans, but you can’t go into London. And in America, the same. Many times he said, if only I could go to London. But he couldn’t afford it. And the English, they didn’t ask my husband to come and choreograph something at Covent Garden. [She is animated and cross.] Ils sont très très closes, comme ça. Maybe 40 years ago he did something for de Valois, it was a long time ago.</p>
<p>Kenneth MacMillan perhaps occupied that dramatic space. Did he take a lot from your husband, did you feel?</p>
<p>No no, that&rsquo;s not the question. It&rsquo;s normal&hellip; my husband has a personality, MacMillan has his personality.</p>
<p>Have you seen his Manon?</p>
<p>C&rsquo;est bien. c&rsquo;est bien, Manon. C&rsquo;est un bon ballet.</p>
<p>Not a big advancement on Carmen, though.</p>
<p>Not nouveau, non.</p>
<p>I would have thought after Carmen everything would have changed.</p>
<p>I think even before it, there was un nouvel air, a new approach to dance.</p>
<p>We here see something very French about your ballets with Petit.</p>
<p>Moi, je pense que&hellip; maybe a little. But it’s finally him, and in all modesty I think it’s more that he is international.</p>
<p>The sensuality seems French.</p>
<p>Well, yes, but sensuality can be English too, anywhere. When you arrive at a certain level, that disappears, the frontiers vanish.</p>
<p>When you went to Hollywood, was it a decision to leave ballet behind?</p>
<p>No no no, we were in Hollywood because the company was there. We knew we wouldn’t stay there. Finally we would continue practising and touring with the company. There was no break. It was just en plus, extra.</p>
<p>Who did you dance with there?</p>
<p>Well, I didn’t dance with Fred Astaire. I love him and that divine dancer who partnered him, Ginger Rogers, but I never did tapdance. No, Astaire asked for Roland to come and do Daddy Long Legs, but all we had was a conversation about the table and chairs number… Leslie (Caron) danced with him in the picture. I regret it very much; I would have loved to do it.</p>
<p>You danced with every great male star, Nureyev, Baryshnikov, Erik Bruhn (pictured left with Jeanmaire in the 1952 Danny Kaye film Hans Christian Andersen), Who was your favourite partner?</p>
<p>Ah, for certain it was my husband.</p>
<p>So loyal!</p>
<p>No, it’s true, it’s true. The way you look to someone is very important, not only to dance with them, but the feelings you have with them. And I had very nice feelings too, when we did Le Jeune homme et la mort with Nureyev too. He was, er, quite&hellip; difficult, but very nice. I had something with Luigi Bonino, with whom I did a lot of musicals. In showbusiness I love to dance with him. For instance, I would have loved to dance with Murru, because the way he look at the partner, you get the feeling you are really a woman. You have to feel that way [she laughs and shrugs], un partenaire qui vous met en valeur, a partner who makes you feel something. I can’t dance any more, unfortunately, but what can we do? Sometimes it’s sad, but&hellip; well, I was lucky to do the musicals, because I could go on. If I think, even now, I can’t go on the stage again, it&rsquo;s terrible. I hope, I still think I will go one more time on stage.</p>
<p>In the film, your husband says, he will die if you don’t go on stage.</p>
<p>Ahahahahah! [she cackles]. Because he knows I lerv it. He pushes me. And I told him the other day, I hope you will stop me&hellip; I don’t want to look.. like un zombie, so please tell me if you think one day it&rsquo;s enough. Well, I will feel it one day. But I hope to do again, quelque chose, one more spectacle. But the day I stop, will be terrible.</p>
<p>Which is the best bit of performing?</p>
<p>Being on the stage. C&rsquo;est une déclaration.</p>
<p>Do you never have stage fright?</p>
<p>Having had one bit of success gives you confidence to weather the time it goes badly. You can’t always be sure that it will work, you just have to do it. At the moment of going on, you have made the decision to go on and do it. If that decision hasn’t been taken you don’t go on.</p>
<p>Do you dance with your husband at a nightclub?</p>
<p>[She looks shocked and is silent for a moment.] We never go to a nightclub! [Laughs.] We haven’t time.</p>
<p>In the documentary, you appear to be very much in love still. Is this true or a performance?</p>
<p>Non non, it’s true, otherwise… [she moues and shrugs] You can’t make a life like this without having a big&hellip; une vraie vérité affective. Long life together if you are not in love, c’est pas possible. You have to have the same intensity, to admire each other, it&rsquo;s an exchange of admiration. There have been couples who lived together all their lives in theatre and adored each other, I don’t think you can have a life without loving each other. If you have the same envies artistiquement, ça vous lie en plus. Even when people who live together are arguing.</p>
<p>Do you keep souvenirs of that Carmen era?</p>
<p>I didn’t keep things, but my husband did. I didn’t think, of course. But he kept the photos, my costume. And of course I kept my Saint Laurent dresses. I have about 15. The costumes are in storage. The Saint Laurent costumes were at Saint Laurent. The Carmen costume was in a cupboard. I would look to see if it was in good shape but I don’t have nostalgia. Sometimes I say if I could live again, I would relive the premiere of Carmen, and it would be marvellous. But I haven’t any real nostalgia. It’s done, and it was marvellous, and I was lucky.</p>
<p>As my husband continued creating, for me the fact that he continued to create new ballets for new dancers, it was as if it was for me. I go automatically forward because he draws me along with him. As long as my husband tells me continue, advance, I have no nostalgia.
