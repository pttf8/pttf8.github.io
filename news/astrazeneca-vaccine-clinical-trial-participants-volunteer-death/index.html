<p>巴西國家衛生監測局今天表示已收到調查資料，指一名志願者在參與英國牛津大學和英國藥廠阿斯特捷利康（AstraZeneca）新冠肺炎疫苗臨床試驗時死亡。</p>
<p>但巴西國家衛生監測局（Anvisa）說仍會繼續試驗，並以醫療保密為理由，未提供進一步細節。牛津大學（Oxford University）今天也說，會繼續在巴西試驗疫苗。</p>
<p>推薦</p>
<p>路透社報導，牛津大學發言人透過聲明表示：「在審慎評估巴西這起案例後，臨床試驗無安全上的疑慮。巴西監管單位以外的獨立審查人員已建議繼續試驗。」</p>
<p>聖保羅聯邦大學（Federal University of SaoPaolo）幫助協調這款疫苗在巴西進行第3階段臨床試驗。校方另外指出死亡的志願者是巴西人，但未說明死者住處。</p>
<p>熟悉內情的消息人士則說，死者若屬於實驗組，試驗早就暫停了。這段評論暗示死亡志願者可能是屬於對照組。

<h3 id="explained-is-volunteer-death-in-brazil-trial-another-blow-for-astrazeneca-vaccine-candidate">&ldquo;Explained: Is volunteer death in Brazil trial another blow for AstraZeneca vaccine candidate?&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/10/AstraZeneca-3.jpg" alt="img">

<p>There has been a death in the late-stage clinical trials of a Covid-19 vaccine being developed by University of Oxford and Swedish-British drugmaker AstraZeneca. What happened and what does this mean for the trials of the closely watched candidate, a version of which is at the forefront of India’s own Covid-19 vaccine race?</p>
<p>What happened and why is it important?</p>
<p>A volunteer in Brazil participating in the trials for the Oxford University-AstraZeneca vaccine candidate, AZD1222, died this week, according to the country’s health surveillance agency, ANVISA. While the regulator, University of Oxford and AstraZeneca, did not elaborate further, a report by CNN Brasil states that the volunteer was a 28-year-old male living in Rio de Janeiro and had died of Covid-19 complications.</p>
<p>Brazil is among the major grounds for testing Covid-19 vaccine globally, with phase 3 human trials in the country enrolling around 5,000 volunteers across the country.</p>
<p>As part of the trial, participants were either given the experimental Covid-19 vaccine or were administered doses of a previously approved vaccine against meningitis — a viral, bacterial or fungal infection that causes inflammation of the brain and spinal cord membranes.</p>
<p>Also read | Deceased AstraZeneca trial volunteer didn’t receive vaccine: Bloomberg report</p>
<p>Does this mean the vaccine is unsafe?</p>
<p>So far, no. According to reports, the participant was not given a shot of AZD1222, which means his death was not a result of the trial vaccine.</p>
<p>AstraZeneca has said that this issue, like all significant medical events, was “carefully assessed” by trial investigators, an independent safety monitoring committee and regulatory authorities.</p>
<p>“These assessments have not led to any concerns about continuation of the ongoing study,” the firm has said in a statement.📣 Follow Express Explained on Telegram</p>

<p>What happens to the trial in Brazil?</p>
<p>Brazil’s regulator has said that the trial will continue.</p>
<p>Testing would have been suspended if the participant had been given the dose of trial Covid-19 candidate. However, as it has been suggested that this person was part of the meningitis vaccine control group, there is no question of the trial running into problems as a result of this death.</p>
<p>What other issues have cropped up in the course of this trial?</p>
<p>This may be the first reported death during this trial, but the candidate did hit a roadblock in September, when a participant in the UK reportedly given the experimental Covid-19 vaccine developed a serious adverse reaction. The trials of this vaccine were put on pause across the globe as a result.</p>
<p>Following reviews that led investigators, a safety monitoring board and the UK government to conclude that the reaction was not caused by the vaccine, trials had resumed at most sites except in the US. The US Food and Drug Administration is still looking into this adverse event and is yet to approve the restart of the trials there.</p>
<p>Also in Explained | What is the new organ scientists have discovered in the throat?</p>
<p>What is the status of the trials for this candidate in India?</p>
<p>Pune-headquartered Serum Institute of India (SII), which has an agreement with AstraZeneca to manufacture this vaccine for low- and middle-income countries, is currently conducting late-stage trials of the candidate in India targeting around 1,600 participants.</p>

<h3 id="astrazeneca-tipped-to-restart-covid-19-vaccine-trial-this-week-report">&ldquo;AstraZeneca tipped to restart COVID-19 vaccine trial this week: report&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://qtxasset.com/fiercebiotech/1603280556/PascalSoriot.jpg/PascalSoriot.jpg?qa7rNdFn4CqNohOO876PsnafOfb754Wf" alt="img">
AstraZeneca could resume the U.S. clinical trial of its COVID-19 vaccine this week, according to a Reuters report. The trial has been paused since early September while the FDA reviews the safety of the vaccine in light of a reported case of a rare spinal inflammatory disorder in the wider program.</p>
<p>Regulators in Brazil, India, South Africa and the U.K. supported the resumption of the trials taking place in their jurisdictions in the weeks after the suspected case of transverse myelitis. However, the FDA has taken longer to review the situation, forcing AstraZeneca to wait to resume a U.S. phase 3 trial that only began shortly before the safety concern emerged.</p>
<p>Now, there are signs AstraZeneca may soon be able to resume the U.S. clinical trial. The article in Reuters is based on comments from four sources. Reuters also accessed a draft letter to participants in the U.K. wing of the clinical development program, dated Oct. 14, that stated the U.S. trial would resume shortly. The draft letter said the FDA “has come to the same conclusion as the other drug regulators including the MHRA.”</p>
<p>Webinar Digitize remote site monitoring with Box Box will discuss how your life sciences organization can continue to propel therapies &amp; devices through the value chain with faster and even more secure site monitoring and auditing. Watch On-Demand</p>
<p>The MHRA, also known as the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, supported the resumption of the COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial after finding there was insufficient evidence to link the investigational product to the illness. Transverse myelitis can be triggered by physical trauma and virus, complicating the task of determining a causal relationship to the vaccine.</p>
<p>Earlier reports said the FDA wanted to see data from other trials of vaccines based on the same viral vector platform as AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 candidate before making a decision. An official at the National Institutes of Health called for AstraZeneca “to be more forthcoming.”</p>
<p>If AstraZeneca gets the green light to resume the trial, investigators will restart enrolling and dosing participants in a 30,000-subject phase 3 study of a vaccine that was among the front-runners before the hold set back progress in the U.S. Since AstraZeneca’s trial went on hold, Johnson &amp; Johnson has paused a phase 3 study of its viral vector COVID-19 vaccine.</p>
<p>The travails of the viral vector prospects are extending the lead of mRNA vaccines in development at Moderna and through the Pfizer-BioNTech collaboration. Data on the vaccines are due next month.

A volunteer in AstraZeneca&rsquo;s coronavirus vaccine trial in Brazil has died.</p>
<p>The man, 28, died from complications of COVID-19, Brazil&rsquo;s O Globo newspaper and CNN Brasil reported. He was the first person to die during any company&rsquo;s COVID-19 vaccine trial.</p>
<p>According to O Globo, he was in the control group and was given a placebo instead of the trial vaccine.</p>
<p>A representative for the Oxford Vaccine Group, which is developing the vaccine with AstraZeneca, told Business Insider it would continue the trials because &ldquo;there have been no concerns about safety.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A participant in AstraZeneca&rsquo;s coronavirus vaccine trial in Brazil has died, marking the first death in a COVID-19 vaccine trial.</p>
<p>The 28-year-old man from Rio de Janeiro died of complications from COVID-19, Brazil&rsquo;s O Globo newspaper and CNN Brasil reported Wednesday.</p>
<p>Both outlets reported that he had volunteered to take part in AstraZeneca&rsquo;s clinical trials for its vaccine, which is being developed with the Oxford Vaccine Group.</p>
<p>According to O Globo, the man was in the trial&rsquo;s control group and was given a placebo instead of the experimental vaccine. Anvisa, Brazil&rsquo;s health body, said it was told of the death on Monday, CNN Brasil reported. The agency declined to identify the participant.</p>
<p>An Oxford Vaccine Group spokeswoman told Business Insider that the trial would continue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Following careful assessment of this case in Brazil, there have been no concerns about safety of the clinical trial and the independent review in addition to the Brazilian regulator have recommended that the trial should continue,&rdquo; Joanna Bagniewska said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All significant medical incidents, whether participants are in the control group or the COVID-19 vaccine group, are independently reviewed,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>The Federal University of São Paulo, where AstraZeneca&rsquo;s Brazil trials are being held, also told Reuters that &ldquo;everything is proceeding as expected, without any record of serious vaccine-related complications involving any of the participating volunteers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A source told Reuters that the trial would have been suspended if the person who died had been given a dose of the trial vaccine.</p>
<p>Some 10,000 people have signed up to take part in AstraZeneca&rsquo;s Brazil trials, with 8,000 people given either the trial vaccine or a placebo so far, O Globo reported.</p>
<p>While AstraZeneca isn&rsquo;t pausing this trial, doing so is a common precaution taken by scientists and drugmakers. In early September, AstraZeneca paused a UK trial for six days after a participant fell ill. And on October 12, Johnson &amp; Johnson paused its vaccine trial after a participant experienced an unexplained illness.</p>
<p>AstraZeneca&rsquo;s vaccine candidate is one of a handful in the later stages of clinical trials.

Milestone payment further bolsters Innate’s cash position</p>
<p>INTERLINK-1 represents first Phase 3 study examining IO approach in R/M SCCHN patients who have been treated with a platinum-based therapy and PD-(L)1 inhibitor</p>
<p>Innate Pharma SA (Euronext Paris: IPH – ISIN: FR0010331421; Nasdaq: IPHA) (“Innate” or the “Company”) today announced that AstraZeneca (LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN) has dosed the first patient in its Phase 3 clinical trial, INTERLINK-1, evaluating monalizumab in combination with cetuximab in patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (R/M SCCHN) who have been previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy and PD-(L)1 inhibitors (“IO-pretreated”). Monalizumab, Innate’s lead partnered asset, is a potentially first-in-class immune checkpoint inhibitor targeting NKG2A receptors expressed on tumor infiltrating cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and NK cells.</p>
<p>Dosing of the first patient in this trial has triggered a $50 million milestone payment from AstraZeneca to Innate.</p>
<p>“We are very pleased that our key late-stage asset, monalizumab, has progressed into Phase 3 with our partner, AstraZeneca. The launch of INTERLINK-1 represents an important financial milestone for Innate, as it triggers a $50 million milestone payment that fortifies our cash position through the end of 2022,” said Mondher Mahjoubi, Chief Executive Officer of Innate Pharma. “The steady and rapid progress of this program is a testament to our strong collaboration with AstraZeneca, and we are hopeful that together we will bring a novel treatment option to this patient population with high unmet medical need.”</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patients with head and neck cancer previously treated with a checkpoint inhibitor are a newly-defined patient population that is currently underserved. We look forward to evaluating the novel combination of monalizumab and cetuximab in the Phase 3 INTERLINK-1 study,&rdquo; said Cristian Massacesi, Senior Vice President, Head of Late Development Oncology R&amp;D, AstraZeneca.</p>
<p>Presented at the ESMO 2019 Congress, the combination of monalizumab and cetuximab demonstrated a manageable safety profile and a response rate of 27.5% (36% and 17% in IO-naïve, n=22, and IO-pretreated patients, n=18, respectively). Based on these Phase 1b/2 results and the unmet need in the IO-pretreated population, AstraZeneca and Innate elected to advance this program directly to a Phase 3 study.</p>
<p>During the ASCO20 Virtual Scientific Program, Innate presented preliminary data from its Phase 2 expansion cohort evaluating monalizumab and cetuximab in IO-pretreated patients (cohort 2), which confirmed an overall response rate (ORR) of 20% across 40 patients enrolled. Overall, the combination therapy data to date supports the expedited development of monalizumab and cetuximab in this indication. Innate intends to provide an update on this data at an upcoming scientific meeting.</p>
<p>About INTERLINK-1:</p>
<p>INTERLINK-1 is a global, multi-center, randomized, double-blind Phase 3 study of monalizumab and cetuximab vs. placebo and cetuximab that will enroll approximately 600 patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (R/M SCCHN) who have been previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy and PD-(L)1 inhibitors (“IO-pretreated”).</p>
<p>The primary endpoint is overall survival (OS) with secondary endpoints including progression-free survival (PFS), ORR, duration of response (DoR), safety and quality of life. Additional details on the INTERLINK-1 clinical trial can be found here.</p>
<p>About the Innate-AstraZeneca monalizumab agreement:</p>
<p>On April 24, 2015, the Company signed a co‑development and commercialization agreement with AstraZeneca to accelerate and broaden the development of monalizumab.</p>
<p>The financial terms of the agreement include potential cash payments up to $1.275 billion to Innate Pharma. Including the $50 million payment triggered by dosing the first patient in the Phase 3 INTERLINK-1 clinical trial, Innate Pharma has received $400 million to date.</p>
<p>AstraZeneca will book all sales revenue and will pay Innate low double-digit to mid-teen percentage royalties on net sales worldwide except in Europe where Innate Pharma will receive 50% share of the profits and losses in the territory. Innate will co-fund 30% of the costs of the Phase 3 development program of monalizumab with a pre-agreed limitation of Innate’s financial commitment.</p>
<p>About Monalizumab:</p>
<p>Monalizumab is a potentially first-in-class immune checkpoint inhibitor targeting NKG2A receptors expressed on tumor infiltrating cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and NK cells.</p>
<p>NKG2A is an inhibitory checkpoint receptor for HLA-E. By expressing HLA-E, cancer cells can protect themselves from killing by NKG2A+ immune cells. HLA-E is frequently overexpressed in the cancer cells of many solid tumors and hematological malignancies. Monalizumab may re-establish a broad anti-tumor response mediated by NK and T cells, and may enhance the cytotoxic potential of other therapeutic antibodies (André et al, Cell 2018).</p>
<p>AstraZeneca obtained full oncology rights to monalizumab in October 2018 through a co-development and commercialization agreement initiated in 2015. The ongoing development for monalizumab is focused on investigating monalizumab in various combination strategies in different malignancies.</p>
<p>About Cetuximab:</p>
<p>Cetuximab is an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody. NK cells mediate cetuximab-induced antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against SCCHN. Genetic and preclinical experiments suggest that ADCC can be enhanced by NK-stimulators.</p>
<p>The activity of cetuximab as a single agent in recurrent and/or metastatic SCCHN is limited, with a 12.6% overall response rate, a median time to progression of 2.3 months and a median overall survival of 5.8 months (Vermorken et al, JCO 2007).</p>

Johnson &amp; Johnson is testing its vaccine in as many as 60,000 volunteers from Peru to South Africa. U.S. regulators have not put a clinical hold on J&amp;J&rsquo;s trial. British drugmaker Astra and partner the University of Oxford last month temporarily stopped tests of their vaccine candidate after a trial participant fell ill. While the Astra study has remained halted in the U.S., where it is being evaluated by regulators, it has resumed in a number of other countries.
