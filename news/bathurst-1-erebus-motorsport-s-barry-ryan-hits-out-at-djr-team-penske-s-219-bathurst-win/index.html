<p>Oct 13th, 2020</p>
<p>Oct 13th, 2020</p>
<p>A year on from Scott McLaughlin&rsquo;s controversial Bathurst 1000 victory, Erebus Motorsport co-owner Barry Ryan has declared DJR Team Penske&rsquo;s win &ldquo;tainted&rdquo; and says they should have been stripped of the title.</p>
<p>McLaughlin was handed his maiden crown at Mount Panaroma amid wild scenes after his teammate Fabian Coulthard was ordered to &ldquo;go-slow&rdquo; when the safety car was out toward the end of the race while placed in third.</p>
<p>That allowed McLaughlin, positioned in second, the opportunity to extend his lead, race back to the pit lane and refuel before re-joining the track with his positions in tact, while the field banked up behind Coulthard.</p>
<p>DJR Team Penske was slapped with a record-breaking $250,000 fine and stripped of 300 team points for the move. They were also handed another penalty on the eve of the Sandown 500 almost two months later after stewards found the team guilty of an engine breach at Bathurst.</p>
<p>Scott McLaughlin&rsquo;s 2019 Bathurst win has not sat well with rival teams. (Getty)</p>
<p>Red Bull Holden Racing Team boss Roland Dane said the team&rsquo;s tactics had not sat &ldquo;comfortably with anyone&rdquo;, and a year on Ryan says the penalties had not gone far enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once they did them for the (team order) and then they had the illegal engine and should have started last on the grid well then 100 per cent they should have been stripped (of the win),&rdquo; Ryan told News Corp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t basically qualify illegally and then still keep your race win.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do anything about it now, but it still sits pretty bad with a lot of people.</p>
<p>Coulthard penalised for Bathurst stunt</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just go back there and try and fix it I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DJR Team Penske boss Ryan Story said the team had moved on from the controversy as it focused on returning to Bathurst to defend its crown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve put that behind us and certainly we went through a process there that saw us receive some penalties and created some controversy,&rdquo; Story said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When it comes down to it, Scott McLaughlin and Alex Premat won the race, end of story. And our focus is now on completing the 2020 season in the best way that we can.

Scott McLaughlin may be busy preparing to defend his Bathurst 1000 title but his opponents are still calling for further action on his contentious 2019 victory.</p>
<p>McLaughlin remained champion despite his DJR Team Penske being accused of intentionally slowing down the rest of the pack to allow the Kiwi a clear path to the crown.</p>
<p>The punishments handed down for the incident saw the second Penske car driven by Fabian Coulthard and Tony D’Alberto demoted and a $250,000 fine imposed while they were also stripped of 300 team points.</p>

<p>Speaking on The Loud Pedalpodcast last year, McLaughlin called on his rivals to move on from the incident.</p>
<p>“There’s some people in other teams that should be focusing on their internal team issues before they kick on about us,” McLaughlin said.</p>
<p>“And that’s what pisses me off a lot about the whole thing.</p>
<p>“We had the fastest car all weekend, we broke the lap record multiple times, we started from pole.</p>
<p>“We did our best job when we could, we lived for the now on the fuel saving strategy and then at the end we got a fair crack with [Shane van Gisbergen] after the Safety Car restart.</p>
<p>“We deserved to win that race. I believe we won it fair and square, it just sucks we have to deal with all this stuff and what probably should be the greatest week of my life.”</p>
<p>It was a controversial finish. Picture Rohan Kelly Source: News Corp Australia</p>
<p>McLaughlin is set to fly overseas to the United States for his IndyCar debut and Roger Penske says the Kiwi’s future is still yet to be decided.</p>
<p>“We haven’t made the decision yet on McLaughlin,” he told Autosport.</p>
<p>“That’s a decision about going to four cars next year in IndyCar.</p>
<p>“Entering McLaughlin at St. Pete is another part of the evaluation of what we’re doing, and of course sponsorship is a part of this too.</p>
<p>“But he’s a special driver. He’s won 48 Supercars races for us, almost 60 poles, three championships&hellip; I have never seen anyone deliver like Scott. But now he would love to get in a series over here.”

<h3 id="ryan-backs-hard-racer-kostecki">&ldquo;Ryan backs ‘hard racer’ Kostecki&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://dscxx9mer61ho.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/099-de-Pasquale-VASC-EV11-20-MH7_1396.jpg" alt="img">
Penrite Racing boss Barry Ryan has declared Brodie Kostecki the team&rsquo;s standout driver of the 2020 Supercheap Auto Bathurst 1000, backing his aggressive driving style.</p>
<p>Co-driving with Anton De Pasquale in the team’s #99 Commodore, the 22-year-old was in the thick of the action for much of his stints on the way to ninth place.</p>
<p>That included a battle with Jamie Whincup that resulted in the seven-time champion misjudging the entry to The Cutting and crashing out.</p>
<p>Kostecki speared off at The Chase while dicing with Chaz Mostert a short time later – making a high-speed rejoin that commentator Mark Skaife declared deserved a penalty.</p>
<p>Much of Kostecki’s time in the car was against the full-time drivers, including running the penultimate stint amid fears De Pasquale would have exceeded driving time limits.</p>
<p>“He was the standout as far as I’m concerned,” Ryan told Supercars.com of Kosetcki, who competed in the PIRTEK Enduro Cup last year in a family team-run wildcard.</p>
<p>“He’s just a hard-arse racer, that’s what we need in this category and in our team. He put it on the line and doesn’t give an inch.</p>
<p>“Most drivers in this category will just give up the corner [if another car is overtaking]. He doesn’t give it up. I was so glad to see it.”</p>
<p>Kostecki held a train of full-timers at bay during his final stint in the car, despite both Penrite Holdens struggling for straightline speed.</p>
<p>“We thought if he could hold position it’d be awesome and we pretty much held position through until the last few laps when Scott Pye got passed him,” added Ryan.</p>
<p>“But he wasn’t slow against the main game drivers. He set us up to be able to get the result we did and our drivers were having to basically drive qualifying laps all day.”</p>
<p>Ryan also praised David Reynolds’ co-driver Will Brown, after the #9 entry limped home 15th while running on seven cylinders.</p>
<p>“He matched Dave all weekend, when we put him in the car he was doing the same lap times as Dave,” Ryan said. “It’s all we can ask of a guy who hasn’t driven much all year.”</p>
<p>Brown, who left Bathurst second in the Dunlop Super2 Series standings, has a previously announced contract to step-up to the main game with Penrite Racing in 2021.</p>
<p>Kostecki meanwhile hopes his Bathurst performance will help secure himself a full-time seat in the top tier, following part-time Super2 campaigns the last two seasons.

STORY STEPS DOWN FROM COMMISSION, RYAN ONBOARD</p>
<p>DJR Team Penske boss Ryan Story has stepped down from the Supercars Commission paving the way for Erebus Motorsport CEO Barry Ryan to take his place.</p>
<p>Story, who is not at the Bathurst 1000, told Auto Action he was pleased to make a contribution to the category via the commission in which he participated since 2018 as an alternate member.</p>
<p>“The commission has worked together extremely well through 2020 to ensure we could continue going racing,” he said.</p>
<p>“Through my two years on the Commission, we have worked incredibly hard to reduce costs and complexity to the benefit of all teams. Supashock, single springs, Xtrac, event format changes, reduced aero and data – these have all come through the Commission during the time I have served as a representative of all teams.</p>
<p>“I made a decision to not continue and step down with my term concluding, which allows someone else to step up and make a contribution – something that I believe is important for the alternate Commissioner role.”</p>
<p>The appointment of Ryan and the reconfirmation of Brad Jones to the Supercars board and commission were two key decision made by the sport’s annual general meeting at Bathurst last night.</p>
<p>Continuing on the Supercars board with Jones are fellow team owner Rod Nash, Seamer, Archer Capital Chairman Peter Wiggs and independent director John Borghetti.</p>
<p>Ryan is an alternate member of the commission and that mean he will attend all meetings but will only vote if another commissioner is absent.</p>
<p>Along with Jones and Ryan, the commission comprises interim chairman Neil Crompton, Jamie Whincup (Triple Eight), Tim Edwards (Tickford Racing), Scott Sinclair (independent) and Sean Seamer and Shane Howard from Supercars.</p>
