Harrogate&rsquo;s Heath Common who</p>
<p>The download single by Heath Common includes two of his greatest poems - When The Dog Bites The Monkey and Powis Square at 4am.</p>
<p>Both feature also in a new poetry anthology entitled Viral Verses published recently by York University Press.</p>
<p>Heath Common, whose journalism career also saw his work turn up in the Sunday Times, is in good company in the new book.</p>
<p>Also included are the likes of Ian McMillan, Dame Margaret Drabble, Mike Harding, Ralph McTell and Milly Johnson.</p>
<p>The anthology is designed to raise much needed funds for the NHS and all profits will be donated directly to the NHS.</p>
<p>Powis Square at 4am, which tells of a chance encounter between the young Heath and Mick Jagger in swinging London in the late 1960s, has been hailed by renowned music biographer Mick Middles as the &ldquo;the most vividly vibrant depiction of a lost bohemia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a spell in New York&rsquo;s arts/music scene and a dazzling career interviewing pop stars and indie legends in the 1980s, Heath has built a high reputation for keeping alive the flame of the Beat generation of Kerouac and Burroughs for more than two decades, not just in verse or music but in his capacity as an in-demand interviewer and performer at literary and music talks and events.</p>
<p>Heath&rsquo;s new single is released today, Thursday and is available for download on Hi 4 Head records online at:</p>

<h3 id="what-the-future-could-look-like-for-six-teeside-town-centres">&ldquo;What the future could look like for SIX Teeside town centres&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/resources/images/11929814/" alt="img">
MASTERPLANS aiming to rejuvenate a raft of Teesside town centres are taking shape as the covid pandemic rumbles on.</p>
<p>Leaders at Stockton Council signed off visions for Billingham, Thornaby, Ingleby Barwick, Norton and Yarm on Thursday following a consultation earlier this year (October 15)</p>
<p>More detail of next steps in the five towns were revealed as well as efforts to get a canopy roof on council-owned Wellington Square Shopping Centre, in Stockton.</p>
<p>Billingham</p>
<p>Leaders have pinpointed better opportunities for younger folk are needed in Billingham on the back of a consultation earlier this year.</p>
<p>Reports revealed opportunities to improve links to John Whitehead Park and invest in parts of the west precinct side of the town centre.</p>
<p>Moves are also afoot to build a new council office building in the town.</p>
<p>Most of Billingham is privately owned by St Modwen and papers revealed the council was working with the firm on “bringing back town centre living”, rejigging retail in the town and developing the council’s new office block in the western precinct.</p>
<p>Cllr Ann McCoy said Billingham had “perhaps played second fiddle” to other places like Thornaby in the past.</p>
<p>The cabinet member added: “It’s Billingham’s time now – I’m not saying that Thornaby doesn’t deserve this but I think it should be Billingham’s time now.”</p>
<p>A report on joint ventures between the council and St Modwen will be unveiled early next year.</p>
<p>Thornaby</p>
<p>Thornaby is set to receive up to £25m from the Government’s “Towns Fund” – a £3.6bn package to 100 places around the country.</p>
<p>A board was set up earlier this year with councillors, the MP for Stockton South Matt Vickers and other public body leaders to work out what the money should go on.</p>
<p>Stockton Council has kept a close eye on the fund – but with strident Thornaby mayor Cllr Steve Walmsley sitting in on Thursday’s cabinet meeting, it came as no surprise when tempers frayed over funding for the town.</p>
<p>The independent mayor wanted to know how much the town would get from a £30m “borrow and spend” fund the council agreed to launch in 2018.</p>
<p>Most of the £30m has been earmarked for Stockton town centre so far, and Cllr Walmsley feared Thornaby would miss out on “its share” due to the separate Towns Fund allocation.</p>
<p>Cllr Walmsley said: “The £25m is all well and good if it comes to fruition we could spend it twice or three times over – but we might be dry-gulched here out of the £30m Thornaby residents are going to be paying back.”</p>
<p>But the meeting heard how certain criteria for the £30m pot ruled out a number of town centres.</p>
<p>Cllr Nigel Cooke, member for housing and regeneration</p>
<p>Cllr Nigel Cooke, cabinet member for housing and regeneration, said it was never the case the pot would be “sliced up like a cake” between areas and no towns had been sidelined.</p>
<p>He added the Thornaby Town Deal was not just about the town centre but was a key part of what it wanted to do anyway.</p>
<p>Poor housing</p>
<p>The council’s consultation earlier this year found a strong desire for something to be done about the Golden Eagle and Phoenix House buildings in the town,</p>
<p>When it came to the town deal priorities, four have been drawn up – including tackling long standing vacant properties in the town centre, better training for residents, a new North-South footpath/cyclepath between the railway station and the town centre, and sorting out poor quality housing in North Thornaby.</p>
<p>Officers say a draft bid will be lodged to the Government in the coming weeks which will offer a steer on what will be pursued using the Towns Fund next year.</p>
<p>Cllr Walmsley wanted sorting out housing to be a top priority.</p>
<p>He added: “If we don’t get this housing element, housing providers are keen on doing something in one area of North Thornaby which would make a real difference to a lot of people.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t only sort out housing needs and gets quality housing, it also could sort out a lot of social problems in the area.”</p>
<p>Cllr Cooke said he was fully aware of the “deplorable state” of housing in Thornaby but added there were other places suffering.</p>
<p>“Without wanting to sound like Ralph McTell, I want to take Steve by the hand and walk him down the streets of Port Clarence and Low Grange and through the town centre ward,” he added.</p>
<p>“Poverty with poor housing stock is not just an issue in North Thornaby.”</p>
<p>Ingleby Barwick</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the study into the future of Ingleby found little desire for new homes on the sprawling estate – with the council now looking at how green spaces will be redeveloped.</p>
<p>The recent opening of the new £14m leisure centre was referenced in the council report but the authority is also keen to create a “masterplan for green space interventions”.</p>
<p>Controversy has bubbled up over “The Muddies” at the back of the Roundhill Estate over concerns wildlife and rare newts have been spotted on land earmarked for a new housing estate.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, talks were continuing over bringing a new 15-acre country park nearby with the new bridge over the River Tees to offer an idyll for residents.</p>
<p>Norton</p>
<p>Studies have modelled a one way system in Norton to try and solve some of its traffic bottlenecks and taxi troubles in the evening as a result of its bustling nightlife.</p>
<p>A one-way loop is being considered on the southern entrance to the High Street, off Norton Road, and out onto the roundabout near the Red Lion pub.</p>
<p>Thursday’s report revealed the strategy for Norton was to examine “creating flexible spaces” for car parking, events and leisure – with the duck pond also an area of focus.</p>
<p>Norton’s masterplan is also set to cover improving car parking layouts and traffic flow in the village.</p>
<p>Yarm</p>
<p>Better long stay car parking and toilets were key themes from the council’s consultation in Yarm.</p>
<p>The town council has long harboured efforts to convert the ground floor of its 18th century town hall into a museum to showcase the town’s history.</p>
<p>While the lower rung of Government takes the lead on that project, Stockton Council says it remains committed to a new long stay car park for the town,</p>
<p>A 60-space pay and display car park has been lined up where the Arncliffe Buildings sit, off West Street – a short walk from the town’s High Street.</p>
<p>But leaders are working through the legal processes and planning next stages for the site.</p>
<p>The council report added improved toilets, cycle parking and business support would form part of Yarm’s masterplan in the coming months.</p>
<p>Cllr Andrew Sherris, independent member for Yarm, was happy to see parking included as a priority and thanked officers for their work.</p>
<p>Stockton</p>
<p>Stockton’s long awaited Globe Theatre is set to be finished and opened in April 2021.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, council officer Richard McGuckin said there’d been discussions ongoing with small and larger retailers in the town which would “emerge over the coming months”.</p>
<p>Authority chiefs are also waiting to hear back on the result of Stockton’s bid to the “Future High Streets Fund”, which it lodged in June, with an answer expected before Christmas.</p>
<p>Plans for a weather shelter at council-owned Wellington Square are also taking shape – while Mr McGuckin told the cabinet car parking demand was also being looked at in the town.</p>
<p>Cllr Cooke said town centres needed to change and the pandemic had accelerated that process.</p>
<p>“We’re heading in the right direction,” he said.</p>
<p>“We’re keen to get on with this by producing a masterplan for each of our towns complete with any development proposals.</p>
<p>“Our view is to bring that back in early 2021. I certainly know each of our town has its own distinct identity which is why we wanted to have these conversations.</p>
<p>“It’s essential any masterplans reflect that and ensures money is identified in each location.”

Ralph McTell has updated his hit song &ldquo;Streets of London&rdquo; to reflect coronavirus times. After speaking with a neighbour about how the homeless could self-isolate in the midst of the pandemic, the legendary 1960s British folk music star who plays acoustic guitar decided to write a new verse to reflect this crisis.
