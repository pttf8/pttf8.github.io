<p>It all started innocently enough, with a single tweet, and here we are now staring into the abyss of internet toxicity, white male fragility and celebrity fandom.</p>
<p>A few days ago, writer Amy Berg engaged in one of social media’s favorite games —One’s Gotta Go—and pitted four of Hollywood’s most famous Chrises—Hemsworth, Pratt, Pine and Evans—against each other.</p>
<p>Ranking Chrises is generally a fun and much needed break from the rest of Twitter discourse because the replies are usually filled with wholesome and/or thirsty photos of some fine looking men. In this case though, the game took a hard pivot and resulted in the absolute flaming of Chris Pratt, who, the internet has decided, is the Worst Chris.</p>
<p>One has to go. pic.twitter.com/HUWnbQOA43 — Amy Berg (@bergopolis) October 17, 2020</p>
<p>For a few years now, what’s viewed as Pratt’s religious conservatism has put him on the outs with a large segment of internet and MCU fandom. One seemingly harmless meme during a slow news cycle though was all it took to fire up people about opinions that seem to have been simmering for some time. In the replies, and quickly across the rest of Twitter, people were quick to point out Pratt’s association with an anti-lgbtq church and his possible pro-Trump leanings as a reason to knock him off the list.</p>
<p>Pratt, who has always maintained that he’s apolitical by nature, has never actually said pro-Trump things nor has he said anything anti-lgbtq, but his social media footprint indicates he may lean far right (he follows Ben Shapiro and Dan Crenshaw). On the outside though, Pratt has also walked a frustratingly neutral political line during a time when many view silence as complicity.</p>
<p>Like it or not, much of celebrity fandom is closely tied to liberal political and social values. Fans won’t stan for anyone who doesn’t hold the same beliefs that they do. We are not, of course, talking about minor differences of opinion on policy issues here, but ideas about representation, equality and social justice. And while Pratt has maintained that he’s “apolitical,” and that he goes to a church that “opens their doors to absolutely everyone” a large swath of MCU fans see it as an attempt to duck and cover.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is that being apolitical is also a privilege, one that Pratt doesn’t seem to recognize. If you are Black or a person of color or LGBTQIA, or disabled or poor or a host of other things, your entire existence is political. It is a constant struggle to maintain your authenticity against systems that seek to oppress and marginalize in favor of the status quo. The type of celebrity that Pratt is trying to cling to, as a neutral and benign force, is one that fans, especially ones who are very online, not just don’t value, but will actively criticize.</p>
<p>The martyrdom of…. Chris Pratt? Okay. — roxane gay (@rgay) October 21, 2020</p>
<p>As the Pratt conversation has spiraled out of control it has also revealed something much deeper about what we value in modern celebrity. It is no longer about just being nice or beautiful or a guy with disproportionately large biceps or a woman with a taut stomach. Fans need their celebrity heroes to stand up as avatars for progressive social and political good, and won’t tolerate anything else.</p>
<p>Every time the Best Chris conversation gets brought up, each actors liberal political bonafides are quickly mentioned as a way to gauge their overall goodness and worthiness. There’s the time Chris Pine walked around in a RGB tank, all the times Chris Evans has railed against Trump on Twitter or even Hemsworth acknowledging how he messed up by cosplaying with Native American ceremonial wear. Maybe these actions are largely performative, but they matter to fans who’ll take any small indication that their celebrity crush is, effectively, on their side.</p>
<p>The Pratt conversation has reached a crescendo as Marvel actors and Pratt’s wife jump into the comments to defend one of their own. First, Katherine Schwarzenegger Pratt waded into the fray on an E News Instagram post and said “being mean is so yesterday.” Next, it was his MCU co-star Mark Ruffalo, who called him a “solid guy” and then Robert Downey Jr., who chided people for “casting stones.” It’s gone on from there, with more famous faces defending the character of a man who doesn’t need defending.</p>
<p>It’s especially galling, and also hasn’t gone unnoticed by fans, that the MCU cast stepped up to defend Pratt when they’ve been sitting on their social media hands while Brie Larson has taken years of online abuse for pushing for more diversity in films.</p>
<p>Where was this energy when Brie Larson was massively harassed for months just for advocating for diversity in the industry? And they all knew about it. Suddenly Chris Pratt gets some criticism and they all come to his defense? The bar is hell. pic.twitter.com/4mmlfxFkig — 𝓪𝓁𝒾𝒶𝓈 (@itsjustanx) October 20, 2020</p>
<p>There’s a part of MCU fandom that has no room for people who won’t vocally go to bat for the things they care about, and that’s what’s happening with Pratt right now. His politics are at best opaque and given he won’t clarify how he feels or what he believes (outside of espousing generic Christian values) a lot of fans have decided he’s just not worth their time. No one is canceling him, no one is harassing him and this isn’t going to stop anyone from watching the next Guardians movie.</p>
<p>Fandoms can turn toxic and bully people off the internet, but that’s not what’s happening here. This isn’t Star Wars nerds coming for Daisy Ridley or racist fans going after Anthony Mackie for being a Black Captain America. That’s not it at all. It’s as simple and clear as a lot of people just saying, LOL we like three other people named Chris better than we like you.

<p><img src="https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/201021080130-chris-pratt-0218-super-tease.jpg" alt="img">
(CNN) Twitter may not be loving Chris Pratt these days, but he gets by with a little help from his friends.</p>
<p>Some celebs did not appreciate the response after a tweet appeared over the weekend saying &ldquo;One has to go,&rdquo; along with pictures of Pratt, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Pine and Chris Evans resulted in many saying Pratt could be tossed from the group known as the four famous Chrises.</p>
<p>The complaints about Pratt cited everything from his allegedly being a Trump supporter to a claim last year that Pratt supported a church with anti-LGBTQ views, the latter of which Pratt has denied.</p>
<p>Some of his Marvel co-stars stepped up to defend him, including Mark Ruffalo, who tweeted that Pratt &ldquo;is as solid a man there is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You all, @prattprattpratt is as solid a man there is. I know him personally, and instead of casting aspersions, look at how he lives his life. He is just not overtly political as a rule. This is a distraction. Let&rsquo;s keep our eyes on the prize, friends. We are so close now. — Mark Ruffalo (@MarkRuffalo) October 20, 2020</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know him personally, and instead of casting aspersions, look at how he lives his life,&rdquo; Ruffalo wrote. &ldquo;He is just not overtly political as a rule. This is a distraction. Let&rsquo;s keep our eyes on the prize, friends. We are so close now.&rdquo;

<h3 id="brian-ericson-all-this-outrage-over-chris-pratt-is-pointless">&ldquo;Brian Ericson: All this outrage over Chris Pratt is pointless&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UozejonNFWEWMgtcPlVRzQAix0M=/0x152:3000x1723/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21978327/AP20223444332985.jpg" alt="img">
Hollywood star Chris Pratt has faced backlash on Twitter this week for his attendance at an L.A. church and for not joining his fellow “Avengers” stars in a fundraiser for Joe Biden, fueling speculation that the worst of the worst could be true: He might think differently than his costars (how horrible!).</p>
<p>It all started as a bit of harmless fun, nothing more than a jovial meme, but some on Twitter have now escalated to calling for Pratt to be canceled for his beliefs — while at the same time, others are just as vociferously condemning the attacks. But the bottom line is that all this outrage is simply pointless, regardless of which side you’re on.</p>
<p>It is, of course, inexcusable behavior to post threatening or violent messages against someone, such as one since-deleted, expletive-laden post that suggested Pratt be “yeeted (thrown) off of every single cliff available.” Another user shared a clip of one of Pratt’s movie characters being bloodily beaten, saying in the caption that the fictional assailant “knew years ago what society needed to do with Chris Pratt” — and another replied with their hope that such an incident would occur this year in real life.</p>
<p>Related Chris Pratt shares two Bible verses to describe his new baby</p>
<p>Pratt has kids, and seeing content like that online takes an emotional toll on a family. It’s also ridiculous to be outraged over people who simply have different beliefs than you do. Many users were upset that Pratt might be a Trump supporter. (We don’t know for sure; the closest evidence we have is that he follows some conservative users on Twitter.)</p>
<p>Others angrily resurfaced old claims that Pratt’s church is “infamously anti-LGBTQ,” saying he “radiates homophobic white christian supremacist energy” — but Pratt rebutted at the time that his church welcomes everyone. Why not instead call out governments that do seek to actively harm and oppress minority communities?</p>
<p>On the other side of the coin, though, are those who are outraged at the outrage. Figures like Ben Shapiro have commented on the incident, and some are saying it’s proof that we’re inching closer to “a 1984” dystopia. Like those attacking Pratt, these comments are just more hysteria.</p>
<p>The behavior seen on this particular Twitter topic — violent, censorial, lighthearted or otherwise — is hardly representative of the country we’re living in today.</p>
<p>For one, the vast majority of those saying Pratt “has to go” are not actually calling for his cancellation — they’re simply responding within the format of the meme, which asks respondents to lightheartedly “vote out” their least favorite of Hollywood’s superhero quartet of Chris-es (Pratt, Evans, Hemsworth and Pine).</p>
<p>For another, data shows that less than a quarter of Americans are on Twitter — and of those active on the platform, only 10% are responsible for 80% of its activity. The behavior seen on this particular Twitter topic — violent, censorial, lighthearted or otherwise — is hardly representative of the country we’re living in today. Why not instead express outrage at those who do perpetrate (sometimes lethal) violence against those they disagree with?</p>
<p>If this incident has proven anything, it’s that Pratt is &hellip; actually a decent guy. His colleagues in the film industry have jumped to defend him, calling him “as solid a man there is,” a “real Christian who lives by principle, has never demonstrated anything but positivity and gratitude,” and “the best dude in the world.” Others say he “has always shown incredible love and generosity to our crews, to his fans, to charities and everyone he encounters” and that “everyone who’s ever crossed paths with (him) knows (his) heart and (his) worth.”</p>
<p>Plus, the fact that he regularly goes to church demonstrates a selfless discipline and a mentality that transcends material concerns like his fame and wealth. As his “Guardians of the Galaxy” director, who’s self-identified as “in some ways, anti-religion” noted, “I’ve spent hours &amp; hours sharing my deepest truths with this man, as he has with me.” That speaks volumes about Pratt’s character.</p>
<p>Even if you disagree with Pratt’s beliefs or politics, shouldn’t we want more people in Hollywood whose character can be so categorically defended? Either way, at the end of the day, Pratt will go on guarding the galaxy and preventing jurassic disasters while we watch comfortably from our couches — logged out of Twitter.

CHRIS Pratt has been accused of &ldquo;violence&rdquo; by a woke mob attacking him for not saying who he&rsquo;s voting for in the presidential election.</p>
<p>Celebrities have come to Pratt&rsquo;s aid after people slammed the Avengers star for keeping silent about politics and the upcoming US election.</p>

<p>4 A woke mob have slammed the celeb on Twitter, saying that &lsquo;silence is violence&rsquo; Credit: Twitter</p>
<p>Woke users on Twitter claimed that &ldquo;silence is violence&rdquo; after Mark Ruffalo defended his Avengers co-star, saying he is &ldquo;as solid a man there is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruffalo added that Pratt &ldquo;is just not overtly political as a rule.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One person mocked this - saying &ldquo;&lsquo;not overtly political&rsquo; CUZ HE HAS THE F****** PRIVILEGE TO NOT BE&rdquo;</p>
<p>A second user said: &ldquo;Silence is violence, Mark. Your friends aren&rsquo;t excluded from that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another person added: &ldquo;Avoiding the topic in this day and age is not cutting it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence is complicity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he doesn&rsquo;t want people to see it that way, all he has to do is open his mouth and say the words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A fourth person said: &ldquo;&lsquo;Not being political&rsquo; is not acceptable as fascism emerges in America.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When good men do nothing, evil wins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another starkly responded to Mark Ruffalo&rsquo;s tweet: &ldquo;Not being overtly political is one of the most political acts there is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;SILENCE IS VIOLENCE&rsquo;</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Chris Pratt was branded the &ldquo;worst Chris in Hollywood&rdquo; as trolls attacked him for his Christian faith and allegedly supporting Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Avengers co-stars Robert Downey Jr and Mark Ruffalo have stepped in to defend Pratt, claiming he is a &ldquo;real Christian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was the subject of a poll where users decided which Chris should be &lsquo;removed&rsquo; from Hollywood.</p>
<p>The competition was between the 41-year-old actor, Chris Pine, Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth.</p>
<p>People were also quick to notice that Pratt was not among the six Avengers stars who agreed to appear at a fundraiser for Joe Biden on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Pratt has never spoken publicaly about the political party he supports, although it&rsquo;s believed he donated to President Barack Obama&rsquo;s campaign in 2012, Newsweek reported.</p>
<p>Katherine Schwarzenegger, Pratt&rsquo;s wife, had earlier slammed the &ldquo;mean&rdquo; social media posts comparing the stars named Chris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this really what we need?&rdquo; Schwarzenegger she wrote.</p>

<p><img src="https://img.jakpost.net/c/2018/11/19/2018_11_19_58952_1542640181._large.jpg" alt="img">
Avengers actors Robert Downey Jr. and Mark Ruffalo have stood up for their costar Chris Pratt after he was voted the “Worst Hollywood Chris” on Twitter.</p>
<p>The two actors spoke up days after writer Amy Berg posted photos of Pratt, Chris Evans, Chris Pine and Chris Hemsworth on her Twitter page on Oct. 17. Alongside the images, she also said: “One has to go.” The tweet is a popular meme format where people choose their least favorite from the choices.</p>

<p>Following her post, many Twitter users quickly responded that they would choose to remove Pratt from the group due to his involvement in an alleged anti-LGBTQ church. Others also accused him of being a white supremacist.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, other Avengers stars such as Evans, Scarlett Johansson and Don Cheadle joined a fundraiser for Joe Biden’s campaign for President of the United States. Many noted Pratt’s absence from the list of actors involved and suspect that he may be supporting incumbent President Donald Trump in the country’s upcoming elections. However, Pratt has not openly endorsed any of the candidates.</p>
<p>After learning of the criticism against Pratt, Ruffalo came to his defense earlier today, Oct. 21.</p>
<p>“You all, @prattprattpratt is as solid a man there is. I know him personally, and instead of casting aspersions, look at how he lives his life,” he said on his Twitter page.</p>
<p>“He is just not overtly political as a rule. This is a distraction,” Ruffalo added. “Let’s keep our eyes on the prize, friends. We are so close now.”</p>

<p>Downey Jr. also expressed his support for Pratt on his Instagram page.</p>
<p>“What a world… The ‘sinless’ are casting stones at my brother, Chris Pratt,” he said alongside a photo of them.</p>
<p>He also called Pratt “a real Christian who lives by principle, has never demonstrated anything but positivity and gratitude.” Downey Jr. then mentioned how Pratt married Katherine Schwarzenegger, the daughter of actor and former Republican governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, whose family “makes space for civil discourse”.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Zoe Saldana shared a quote by the late artist Tupac Shakur that said: “No matter how hard it gets, stick your chest out, keep your head up and handle it.”</p>

<p>“You got this @prattprattpratt,” she told Pratt. “Your family, friends, colleagues [and] everyone who’s ever crossed paths with you knows your heart and your worth!”

<h3 id="chris-pratts-hollywood-defenders-only-cry-bullying-when-white-mens-feelings-get-hurt">&ldquo;Chris Pratt’s Hollywood Defenders Only Cry ‘Bullying’ When White Men’s Feelings Get Hurt&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1686,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1603318861/201021-dacosta-pratt-tease_ajm3t9" alt="img">
Every few months on Twitter, regular people rank the Hollywood Chrises. Out of Chris Pine, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, and Chris Pratt, one—as they say—gotta go. Nearly every time, Wonder Woman hunk Pine easily comes out on top while Thor’s Hemsworth sluggishly follows in second place. Captain America’s Chris Evans, bless him, does not have to bring up the caboose because inevitably, it’s always Pratt, of Guardians of the Galaxy and Parks and Recreation fame, who can be sacrificed in the imaginary world where only three chiseled Chrises can make it to superhero franchise heaven.</p>
<p>Strangely, several of Pratt’s celebrity friends and franchise co-stars stepped up to scoldingly defend the actor from the white Chris ranking gutter, including Mark Ruffalo, Josh Gad, James Gunn, and—help us—Zoe Saldana (who famously claimed “there’s no such thing as people of color” before later donning Blackface and a prosthetic nose to play Nina Simone in a widely panned film which she recently said she regretted doing). Ruffalo, known almost as much for his progressive political campaigning as for his acting, was the most surprising actor to step up to Pratt’s defense, writing, in a weirdly hedging tweet:</p>
<p>“You all, @prattprattpratt is as solid a man there is. I know him personally, and instead of casting aspersions, look at how he lives his life. He is just not overtly political as a rule.”</p>
<p>Ruffalo’s statement is not only in response to the totally unserious Chris rankings, but to some Twitter users’ reasoning for putting Pratt last: He attends Hillsong, a trendy Hollywood evangelical church that condemns homosexuality, and has never openly contradicted the church’s stance; he has not attended anti-Trump fundraisers with the rest of the former Parks and Rec cast; and on both Twitter and Instagram, he follows several reactionary conservative media personalities, politicians, and organizations—like Ben Shapiro, Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse, and PragerU.</p>
<p>In an industry where a very loud bigot like Mel Gibson can still have a roiling Oscar-nominated career (his next major role is as a gritty Santa Claus), you can imagine why the humble people of non-celebrity Twitter would cast aspersions at money-raking stars who refuse to speak out against injustice and instead seem more likely to be listening to Ben Shapiro rants on YouTube. Hollywood’s own standards, like Pratt’s ranking amongst the Chrises, are so low that the only institutions left to hold anyone accountable are idle Twitter denizens, using their screens to hide away from a pandemic and abetting government that together have spent the summer systemically wiping out Black people and the poor.</p>
<p>“ Too controlling to just leave the Twitter plebes alone to talk their shit, box office smashing actors must protect their own from any perceived dip in marketability. ”</p>
<p>Of course, Iron Man marched in to offer his own valiant defense of the most dubious Chris. On Instagram, Robert Downey Jr.—who has become increasingly smarmy since his career revival in the previous decade—wrote:</p>
<p>“What a world&hellip; The ‘sinless’ are casting stones at my #brother, Chris Pratt&hellip; A real #Christian who lives by #principle, has never demonstrated anything but #positivity and #gratitude&hellip; AND he just married into a family that makes space for civil discourse and (just plain fact) INSISTS on service as the highest value. If you take issue with Chris,,, I’ve got a novel idea. Delete your social media accounts, sit with your OWN defects of #character, work on THEM, then celebrate your humanness&hellip; @prattprattpratt I #gotyerbackbackback.”</p>
<p>Parsing such a statement will take a degree of close reading. Downey highlights Pratt’s Christianity, sarcastically calling the latter’s Twitter poll critics “sinless” while earnestly calling his celebrity BFF “principle[d].” Downey also works in an awkward plug for the Schwarzenegger-Shriver dynasty, a cynical “bipartisan” union that benefits from Trump-era revisionist history. Pratt “married into” the family by wedding Katherine Schwarzenegger, who herself came to her husband’s defense by decrying “cyber bullying.” The whole thing would be disturbing if it weren’t hilarious that a very wealthy white man, with a successful career and plenty of rich and powerful friends and in-laws, must corral his people to defend his increasingly apparent closet conservatism (and polled unlikeability relative to the other Chrises) from bored people on Twitter. Notably, none of the actors who have defended Pratt have done the same for either Tessa Thompson or Brie Larson, who have been on the receiving end of racist and misogynist—respectively, and for Thompson, both—attacks from Marvel fans.</p>
<p>The Pratt affair is so central in the world of digital pop culture not because it intrinsically matters, but because it’s analogous to the disproportionate influence of the wealthy and patriarchal in modern society. Too controlling to just leave the Twitter plebes alone to talk their shit, box office smashing actors must protect their own from any perceived dip in marketability. Yet, this microcosm offers some hope about what stubborn refusal can achieve for the masses: like Gal Gadot’s cringe “Imagine” video from earlier this year that just “didn’t transcend,” Pratt’s real-life Avengers rallying call will not shuttle him to the top.

The 14th anniversary of The Prestige felt like as good an excuse as any to create a package devoted to the movie and TV twists through the years that have stunned us, destroyed us, and changed the way we think. (The twist here is that we&rsquo;re celebrating a 14th anniversary rather than waiting one more year for a round number.)
