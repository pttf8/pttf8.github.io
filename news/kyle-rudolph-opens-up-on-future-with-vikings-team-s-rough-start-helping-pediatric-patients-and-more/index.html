<p>The Minnesota Vikings didn&rsquo;t have the start they envisioned at 1-5, which is why they are fortunate to have a leader like Kyle Rudolph on the roster. Rudolph is in the midst of his 10th season with the Vikings, and has experienced the highs and lows. He is fifth in franchise history in receptions (435) and receiving touchdowns (48), and 10th in receiving yards (4,277) &ndash; making Rudolph arguably the greatest tight end in franchise history.</p>
<p>Rudolph has been a Pro Bowler on the field, but a Hall of Famer off it thanks to his work with the University of Minnesota Masonic Children&rsquo;s Hospital. The Vikings tight end and his wife, Jordan, have been involved with the hospital for a decade, creating &ldquo;Kyle Rudolph&rsquo;s End Zone,&rdquo; which was created to help children and teenagers play, relax, engage in healing therapies, and socialize with other kids who know what it&rsquo;s like to spend time in the hospital.</p>
<p>Rudolph continues to give back to the hospital, teaming up with Polaris to auction off his personal, Vikings-inspired custom Slingshot. All the proceeds from the auction will be donated to the University of Minnesota Masonic Children&rsquo;s Hospital. Rudolph has already raised over $20,000 from the auction.</p>

<p>In an exclusive interview with CBSSports.com, Rudolph discusses the mission behind &ldquo;Kyle Rudolph&rsquo;s End Zone,&rdquo; the Vikings' start, and his future with the franchise he&rsquo;s spent a decade playing for.</p>
<p>The Vikings obviously aren&rsquo;t off to the start you guys envisioned at 1-5. What did you guys say to each other going into the bye week?</p>
<p>Rudolph: &ldquo;The biggest thing was &hellip; it gave us an opportunity to go back and study not only the things we did well for the first six weeks, but not only what we were doing that was causing us to lose football games. When you go back and look at it &ndash; for us as an offense &ndash; we break things down and study and you wouldn&rsquo;t believe at 1-5 you would be in the top five and top three in almost 10 statistical categories. And when you look at that it makes you wonder how we are losing football games. Then you go and look at &lsquo;okay, what are we not doing so well&rsquo; and then you see our lack of execution in the third quarter and turnovers. Just like we were in the top three in a lot of categories, we were in the bottom three &ndash; if not last &ndash; in all of those.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It really gave us a perspective of what we got to do moving forward. We studied it and now we got to address it. We have a 10-game season starting with three straight division games to get this thing back on track.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;re not getting the target share you used to be getting, but at the same time the Vikings are a top-10 running offense.</p>
<p>Rudolph: &ldquo;For me, I&rsquo;m not getting the targets I&rsquo;m accustomed to getting. With that being said, I am still on the field and I have a job I like to do &ndash; and that&rsquo;s a blocker in the run game and a lot of times that&rsquo;s a pass blocking in the pass game. For me, that&rsquo;s something I always have to work on, I always continue to get better at &ndash; something that has become very natural. That&rsquo;s been what I&rsquo;ve worked on the most.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Yannick Ngakoue trade was kind of sudden. He was here for a minute it seemed and all of a sudden he was on another roster.</p>
<p>Rudolph: &ldquo;Being here for 10 years, I have complete faith in Rick (general manager Rick Speilman) and our front office and the guys that are making decisions on our football team currently and the future of our football team. They felt like that was a move that was best for our football team.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s something that I learned over my time here, the decisions Rick has made are in the best interest of our football team.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Are you concerned about your future with Minnesota?</p>
<p>Rudolph: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way things go. When you don&rsquo;t win football games everybody&rsquo;s job is on the line. That&rsquo;s the nature of our business. If you&rsquo;re not performing, if you&rsquo;re not winning football games, then everybody has to look at themselves in the mirror and your job is always at risk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You were on a team that started 1-5 before in 2013. Do you share that experience with some of the guys on this team?</p>
<p>Rudolph: &ldquo;I think the biggest thing is &ndash; not necessarily going back to a year where we started 1-5 and we finished 3-13 &ndash; but going back to a year like 2017 where we started 2-2 and reached the NFC Championship Game. We won eight straight games to get to 10-2. That&rsquo;s kind of where we&rsquo;re at as a football team. Yea we&rsquo;re still 1-5, but there&rsquo;s 10 weeks left in the season.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows what could happen. So it&rsquo;s about going out this week and like I said, we got three straight division games coming up. What better way to get ourselves back on track by going out and playing well in those games. Anything cna happen in the next 10 weeks and we&rsquo;ll see where we are when the chips fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the extra team in the postseason, you guys still have a legitimate shot.</p>
<p>Rudolph: It seems farfetched to be talking about the playoff race, and it certainly will take an astronomical feat for us to climb our way back in. We won eight straight games before, so if we go off and rattle eight straight games and we&rsquo;re sitting at 9-5 &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t seem so crazy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the biggest thing we keep relaying to our younger guys. Things may not be bright right now, but we lost to two (previously) undefeated teams by one point. We&rsquo;re not as far off as our record may seem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Can you explain &lsquo;Kyle Rudolph&rsquo;s End Zone&rsquo; and the mission behind it?</p>
<p>Rudolph: &ldquo;We came up with an idea for space at the hospital after spending a lot of time with patients and families and really getting to know them and asking them aside from things they already had at the hospital, what would be something that would make your visit &ndash; as short or long as it is &ndash; more enjoyable. That goes for patients, for siblings, and quite honestly for parents because when you&rsquo;re there &ndash; whether with a patient or with siblings &ndash; it&rsquo;s not easy for them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we were able to create a space where these kids can escape &ndash; which we have &ndash; the realities of their doctor&rsquo;s appointments, their hospital visits, and in some cases their extended stays at the hospital, it lets them be a kid. Quite honestly, that was our main goal. At times, their childhood is taken away from them when they check into the hospital. We just wanted to provide them with a little bit of that back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What amenities are in the hospital?</p>
<p>Rudolph: &ldquo;First of all, we met with a group of kids &ndash; the hospital kid council &ndash; and although I think I&rsquo;m pretty cool and my ideas are pretty cool, often times kids don&rsquo;t agree with me and they don&rsquo;t think what I think is cool (laughing). We were able to pick the brains of the kids' council at the hospital &ndash; which is comprised of current patients, former patients, siblings of patients &ndash; and really get a feeling of what they want in the space. We came up with a space that has a basketball hoop, a sports simulator that has all different kinds of sports on it. Obviously there&rsquo;s a video game section with four TVs and XBoxes. There&rsquo;s actually a full kitchen, which is used for baking and cooking but it also is used for arts and crafts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we also have something for the older demographic for the teenagers &ndash; and often times they are the ones forgotten about in a children&rsquo;s hospital &ndash; so we have this lounge are where the teenagers can hang out. When friends are coming to visit, they don&rsquo;t have to sit in their rooms because often times you don&rsquo;t want to sit next to mom and dad to hang out with friends. You want to get away and hang out, that&rsquo;s what the lounge is for. And then we have a &ldquo;forest&rdquo; area, which is kind of a quiet space for kids to kid of go back and read books and do things like that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We try to, in conjunction with the kids council, come up with anything they need or they want to do while they&rsquo;re there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How involved are the Vikings in the project?</p>
<p>Rudolph: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of the things I love most about our organization. Being here for 10 years, I&rsquo;ve gotten to see first hand the work the Wilf family (Vikings owner Zygi Wilf) does. Our space is actually built right next to a space the Wilf family developed &ndash; a bunch of conference rooms, an auditorium where they can do telemedicine but can also be a movie theater for kinds where they can do down and watch movies and have other events.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Wilf family have been extremely involved at the hospital, not just in supporting our initiative, but also initiatives of their own. The Vikings have had a relationship with the University of Minnesota Masonic Children&rsquo;s Hospital for over 45 years, so this was something I was introduced to when I was a rookie &ndash; and this was something I was passionate about and wanted to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What led to Polaris donating your customized version of the Slingshot? That&rsquo;s something I would want to ride!</p>
<p>Rudolph: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a ton of fun. Three years ago I got the Slingshot from Polaris and we were able to customize it in Vikings purple and gold and it has the Vikings logo on the hood along with my number stitched in the headrest. This year, I actually got a Polaris Ranger which is more like a workman truck as opposed to the Slingshot &ndash; which is a lot more fun. As we all know, as a guy when you get one toy &ndash; often times your wife will make you get rid of the other. She said we&rsquo;re not keeping both in the garage. You have to get rid of the Slingshot if you want to keep the Ranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just felt like it was a great opportunity for us in a year where we couldn&rsquo;t do the fundraising events we typically do, it would be a great way to raise some money for the hospital in doing that. A Vikings fan can get a one-of-a-kind vehicle and it is something that would be really cool for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kyle Rudolph/Kyle Rudolph&rsquo;s End Zone</p>
<p>Now when you had the Slingshot, did you roll with that into practice?</p>
<p>Rudolph: &ldquo;Oh absolutely! Especially in Minnesota, when the summertime hits and the weather gets nice, there&rsquo;s noting better than riding around in that baby! I drove it all around town, drove it to and from work a lot, and it was something I really enjoyed. In Minnesota, you kind of celebrate the warm weather in the summertime. There was no better way to celebrate than driving around in that Slingshot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I heard it gets pretty cold up there around January and February.</p>
<p>Rudolph: &ldquo;So we set a record for the most snowfall &ndash; the earliest in 100 years &ndash; last week. Winter has reared its ugly head up here a bit early, but it makes you appreciate the gorgeous summers up here that&rsquo;s for sure.&rdquo;

<h3 id="why-the-washington-football-team-should-not-tank-in-2020-part-2">&ldquo;Why the Washington Football Team should not tank in 2020: Part 2&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/fetch/w_2000,h_2000,c_fit/https%3A%2F%2Friggosrag.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fgetty-images%2F2017%2F07%2F1277058885.jpeg" alt="img">
SEATTLE, WASHINGTON - SEPTEMBER 27: Russell Wilson #3 of the Seattle Seahawks looks to throw the ball in the first quarter against the Dallas Cowboys at CenturyLink Field on September 27, 2020 in Seattle, Washington. (Photo by Abbie Parr/Getty Images)</p>
<p>Okay, I’m going to take one more shot at this. And then, as happened with Kaiser Soze, you’ll never hear from me again. At least about tanking.</p>
<p>I have already spelled out my arguments on why the Washington Football Team should not tank the remainder of the 2020 season in effort to outduel the Jets et. al. for Clemson QB Trevor Lawrence. The consensus response I got was “of course, you don’t say you’re tanking. But yeah, you kind of do.” Any other move is a sucker play, dooming you to years of mediocrity or worse.</p>
<p>My primary argument for not tanking is that it doesn’t work. I won’t rehash it. You can read it here. I’m going to try a different tactic today. Today’s argument is that you don’t tank because you don’t have to in order to get good.</p>
<p>You want my evidence? The 1985 Cleveland Browns. The 2008 San Diego Chargers. The 2010 Seattle Seahawks. The 2011 Denver Broncos. The 2013 Green Bay Packers. The 2014 Carolina Panthers.</p>
<p>Those six teams are generally considered the weakest division winners in the modern NFL history. They captured a division crown with a record at or below .500. It is likely that the 2020 NFC East winner will join that cringeworthy club.</p>
<p>But just how cringeworthy is it? Five of these six teams improved on their record in the following season. The one that didn’t, Seattle, achieved the same record in 2011, before improving in both 2012 and 2013.</p>
<p>In the short term at least, all of these teams had notable successes – consistently making the playoffs. Within a few years of their embarrassing division championships, the Browns and Packers would make it to the Conference championship. The Panthers would make it to the Super Bowl. And both the Seahawks and Broncos would take home the Lombardi Trophy.</p>
<p>Not a single one of them tanked.</p>
<p>Okay – I hear your objections already. Half of these teams saw success on the heels of these down seasons because they already had franchise QBs in place. Both the Packers and Panthers underperformed in these down years because injuries slowed Aaron Rodgers and Cam Newton.</p>
<p>There is no rationale for tanking for a QB if you merely have to wait for your QB to get healthy. And the Chargers already had Philip Rivers in place. They weren’t mediocre in 2008 due to injury. They were mediocre because – well, they are the Chargers, and being the Chargers means losing lots of games you really should win.</p>
<p>I’ll grant you these three examples aren’t the strongest, so I will leave them out of the rest of the discussion. I’ll leave them out after just noting this one thing. 100% of the teams on this list, including these three, improved a great deal after NOT TANKING in a season which looked pretty dismal. That’s 100%.</p>
<p>Maybe you think the Browns also had their franchise QB in place in 1985, and they just needed time to let Bernie Kosar develop a bit. Yeah, maybe. This requires you to believe that Bernie Kosar was an elite QB. He was not.</p>
<p>He was good – don’t get me wrong. He was better than anybody currently on the Washington Football Team roster. But he was not elite. Kosar had one truly exceptional season – 1987 – in an otherwise okay career. In other words, Bernie Kosar was not a QB who you need to tank for. There are Bernie Kosars floating around out there. Jameis Winston might be a Bernie Kosar. Ryan Fitzpatrick already is.</p>
<p>The Browns, after sputtering to a division title in 1985, went 12-4 in 1986, making it to the Conference championship game where they were one John Elway drive (“The Drive”) away from the Super Bowl. In 1987, they were one fumble (“The Fumble”) away from the big game.</p>
<p>Neither the Seahawks nor the Broncos would come up short. They both won Super Bowls within a few years of not tanking.</p>
<p>You cannot say they had franchise QBs in place. During their seasons of not tanking, their QBs were Matt Hasselbeck and – wait for it – Tim Tebow. It is true that both teams would see the need to move on from these signal callers in order to continue to improve. I am not saying that Washington doesn’t need to significantly increase the level of play at the position. I’m saying that both the Seahawks and Broncos were able to do exactly that. And they did it without tanking.</p>
<p>Sure, you say, if we could get Russell Wilson, of course we’d be a lot better. That’s the point. The Seahawks did get Russell Wilson. They got him in the third round after five other QBs had already been taken. And you know what else they did? They built a first-rate defense. They put quality coaches in place. They found a good running back. And they built a winning culture. A culture that did not allow for quitting. Love him or hate him, Pete Carroll does not coach teams that tank.</p>
<p>Okay, you say. Stop already with the Russell Wilson example. Eventually, somebody hits the Power Ball. Maybe Wilson was simply a fluke. Let’s look at how Denver did it.</p>
<p>They moved on from Tebow when they had the chance to sign Peyton Manning as a free agent. Manning instantly elevated the QB play and the team right along with it. How many times does a Peyton Manning become available as a free agent?</p>
<p>Not often, but here’s the point. When he did become available, Denver was ready to snap him up. Do you really believe Peyton Manning would have signed with Denver had they tanked in 2011? How would he have responded to John Elway, had the pitch been “I know we were just 2-14 this year, but you see, we were positioning ourselves for a better draft pick. Now come on, big guy, sign this deal.”</p>
<p>Obviously I don’t know the answer to this, but what I do know about elite, highly competitive athletes is that they do not choose to play for a team that uses losing as an institutional strategy.</p>
<p>Money may matter a great deal to free agents, but if they have their choice, they do not go to a losing franchise. They understand that losing is a little bit like a virus, and though you may think you have it under control, it does not take much for it to spread. I have already made this point, so I won’t belabor it. Suffice to say, you don’t attract quality by being bad. You don’t attract quality by tanking.</p>
<p>Just to finish up the Denver example: Though Manning led them to great playoff success, they did not win a Super Bowl until his fourth and final season, when injuries forced him to the bench. Brock Osweiler played better than Manning in 2015. They won the Super Bowl that year because they had been developing the best defense in the league over the preceding several years. The QB play merely complemented that defense.</p>
<p>If you think that these precedents don’t have any relevance for the current Washington Football Team situation – either because franchise QBs were already in place, or because they lucked into guys like Wilson or Manning – that doesn’t matter. Maybe you think I’m dissing Bernie Kosar, who was actually the Pat Mahomes of his day. Also doesn’t matter (And is verifiably insane).</p>
<p>You can also say that the Washington Football Team has plenty of holes, and that it is not as good as any of the above-mentioned teams were in their poor division-winning seasons. I won’t argue that. I don’t have to. I’m not promising the Washington Football Team will win the Super Bowl in three years if only they try their hardest this year. I’m saying there is overwhelming evidence that trying to win is a more reliable way of improving than trying to lose.</p>
<p>These were teams that easily could have tanked, but did not. And they all got better after refusing to tank. Every – Single – One. I don’t really care how it happened. In addition to raw talent, winning requires attitude, effort, and good habits. It is an acquired skill. And you do not acquire it by losing.

Aboard Air Force OneEn Route Joint Base Andrews</p>
<p>October 29, 2020</p>
<p>7:40 P.M. EDT</p>
<p>MS. MCENANY: So I just wanted to give you guys an explanation of where we were. We were obviously outside of Fort Bragg. So the President met with Army Special Operations Forces. He gave the Presidential Unit Citation to our heroes who conducted the al-Baghdadi raid. What was it — a year and three days ago today? In Syria. It was a really special moment. It meant a lot to the President. He was with our heroes for about an hour, just having casual conversation, taking their questions, talking to them.</p>
<p>And then he ended the visit by paying his respects at a Special Forces memorial. So it was all in all about what — an hour and a half, I think? Is about right.</p>
<p>And I think that’s about it for me. Did you guys see the breaking news while I was gone?</p>
<p>Q Lil Wayne (inaudible).</p>
<p>MS. MCENANY: Well, there’s that breaking news. The Lil Wayne breaking news — which, I will say, his account was not hacked. I know that there are reports out there that it was hacked. That’s not the case.</p>
<p>The President met with Lil Wayne this morning, in Miami, in a really good, productive meeting. Lil Wayne’s team had been talking to the White House, and Lil Wayne directly to the White House, for a little bit.</p>
<p>And it just materialized with the tweet today. It was a good meeting that the President had.</p>
<p>Q Has the President been watching the stock market? It was — it’s been down by 2,000 points over the last couple days. It went up a little bit more today, but it’s been down. I’m just curious if he has a reaction to that.</p>
<p>MS. MCENANY: I haven’t spoken to him directly about that. But I know he was quite enthused by the GDP numbers this morning: 33.1 percent, largest-ever growth in a single quarter. And it’s more — it’s making up about two thirds of what we lost in the pandemic. So he’s very encouraged by that. And we continue to exceed expectations.</p>
<p>Another thing I would note is, did you guys see the other breaking news when I was gone, or — Hunter Biden?</p>
<p>Q About Iran? Or —</p>
<p>MS. MCENANY: No. I’ll give you a hint: Hunter Biden.</p>
<p>Q Then no. (Inaudible.)</p>
<p>MS. MCENANY: A DOJ source confirmed that there’s been an FBI —</p>
<p>Q (Inaudible.)</p>
<p>MS. MCENANY: No, I’m — no, I’m just noting that there is a DOJ source that confirmed that there’s been an FBI investigation going back to 2019 into Hunter Biden and his associates for money laundering. And the reporting says it’s still open today. I don’t know whether that’s true. I guess that’s for you guys to ask the questions.</p>
<p>So, for your colleagues, your DOJ beat reporters. So get them to ask some questions so we can find out.</p>
<p>Q Did the President discuss that with the Attorney General at all?</p>
<p>MS. MCENANY: No. The President was unaware of that when the reporting came out. So, in fact, I saw the reporting on my phone and I showed him it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Q When you say that, “the team that did the al-Baghdadi raid,” do you mean —</p>
<p>MS. MCENANY: Yes.</p>
<p>Q — all of them? Most of them? Half of them? Can you give me a sense of —</p>
<p>MS. MCENANY: Yeah, I can’t confirm exactly who was there. But I can just say that it was the team that conducted the al-Baghdadi raid and got the Presidential Unit Citation. I think this is the second one, I believe, this President has — has given out. So a very special, significant moment. And it was really wonderful to see the President interacting with our brave men and woman in uniform.</p>
<p>Q Kayleigh, Dr. Fauci has made — is back in the news for advocating for a national mask mandate. Has the President — is he aware of that? Does he have any response to that call, and as cases go up in key states?</p>
<p>MS. MCENANY: I haven’t seen Dr. Fauci’s comments. The President has always followed CDC guidelines, which is: Wear a mask when you can’t social distance. That’s where the President has always stood. Yeah, nothing has changed.</p>
<p>Q Was the President informed and was he concerned about what happened with his supporters at the Nebraska rally the other night after he left? Getting stuck in the cold for several hours.</p>
<p>MS. MCENANY: That’s — the President loves his supporters. And in that particular case, we had — and again, this is more a question for the campaign, so I’m just going to repeat what they’ve said, which is that we had about double the buses as what the campaign normally has there. There were tents where there was hand warmers available, hot chocolate. There were some road closures that made it logistically difficult.</p>
<p>But the President loves his supporters; he wants to make sure they’re taken care of. And, you know, we will — we look at each and every rally to make sure that that happens. But — but just make no mistake, he loves the men and women of Omaha and wanted to make sure that — that they were taken care of in the aftermath, and certainly as we saw the reporting.</p>
<p>Q Was that a factor at all in the decision to postpone today’s rally, to not have another situation where attendees might be in some —</p>
<p>Q Harm’s way.</p>
<p>Q — harm’s way?</p>
<p>MS. MCENANY: That was the campaign’s decision, but as I understand it, there was bad weather and very strong winds. So it just — it wasn’t possible to do.</p>
<p>Q Kayleigh, the President has previously said that he might be willing to put money into his own campaign. Do you know if that’s been discussed or whether he’s still considering putting money into his own campaign?</p>
<p>MS. MCENANY: I’d have to refer you to the campaign on that. But, you know —</p>
<p>Q But you’ve been speaking on behalf of campaign. Can we ask in your —</p>
<p>MS. MCENANY: Yeah, he’s —</p>
<p>Q — personal capacity if that’s the case? Or —</p>
<p>MS. MCENANY: No, you know, I’ve just been repeating the statements that the campaign put out. But I can’t provide any new information. That’d be the campaign.</p>
<p>Q Does the President have plans to speak with Emmanuel Macron in France? Does he have plans to speak with Emmanuel Macron in France (inaudible)?</p>
<p>Q Macron.</p>
<p>MS. MCENANY: Not that I’m aware of, but, you know, who knows.</p>
<p>All right, we’re just trying to get from place to place as we approach this five- state [event] swing.</p>
<p>Q Kayleigh, there was an NBC report about retaliation for the Soleimani killing against Pentagon officials. Is there any concern of something imminent happening?</p>
<p>MS. MCENANY: What was it?</p>
<p>Q There was an NBC report about retaliation by Iran for the Soleimani killing.</p>
<p>Q That they would target certain ambassadors, U.S. officials, or that kind of thing.</p>
<p>MS. MCENANY: Yeah, I — I haven’t seen that or I haven’t looked into that. But, you know, the President is very proud of his decision and our good, hardworking military men and women who are the ones who took out Soleimani and al-Baghdadi. Tremendous accomplishments. And I think our heroes deserve all the credit there, and this President for being a real leader and making those decisions.</p>
<p>But I got to go, guys.</p>
<p>(Goes off the record.)</p>
<p>(Goes on the record.)</p>
<p>Q How did Lil Wayne come together?</p>
<p>MS. MCENANY: I mean, just back on the record, there’s just been conversations that have been going on for quite some time. I mean, I think the President — you’re seeing a number of people come in and support him because his accomplishments speak for themselves.</p>
<p>I mean, permanent HBCU funding, criminal justice reform, lowest black unemployment, homeownership going up, wages going up. And, of course, the pandemic — we had to artificially shut down the economy, but it’s coming back, and I think the GDP numbers today are evidence of that. And I think you’re seeing a lot of supporters come off the sidelines and want to join the President in a second term.</p>
<p>Q Is the President concerned about the rising cases that we’re seeing across the country? I mean, is he expressing some worry about, you know, a worsening situation economically, for example?</p>
<p>MS. MCENANY: Economically?</p>
<p>Q Yes.</p>
<p>MS. MCENANY: The President believes that we’re going to continue to go on the trajectory we’re currently on, which is back to the hottest economy in modern history. We’re constantly monitoring the pandemic. But it’s worth noting, as the President has consistently, that we’ve seen an 85 percent reduction in the fatality rates. We have working therapeutics now. We’re at a different place now than we were in March, certainly. We have a great testing system — a high volume of tests.</p>
<p>And I think what you’re seeing is, if you’re under 70, your chances of surviving are upwards of 99 percent. And above 70, it’s still very close to that range because it’s testament to remdesivir and dexamethasone, and the President breaking down barriers, deregulating, and making those possible.</p>
<p>And we’re still hopeful for a vaccine by the end of the year. It’d be the fastest vaccine in history, and President Trump deserves all the credit for that.</p>
<p>Thank you, guys.

<h3 id="how-to-manage-a-high-performance-remote-sales-team">&ldquo;How to Manage a High-Performance Remote Sales Team&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://builtin.com/sites/default/files/styles/og/public/2020-10/20201030-Stout-RemoteSalesManagement.png" alt="img">
If you truly value your team, remain flexible, work together and communicate clearly, you’ll get through any period of uncertainty — including a global pandemic.</p>
<p>Over the years, I’ve learned a thing or two about managing high-performance remote sales teams. In this time of heightened uncertainty, however, I am seeing a few important deviations from the norm. Schedules are more unpredictable than usual. Both my team and customers have children at home. Being unable to meet face-to-face makes connecting with the team — and with customers — harder. Market fluctuations impact buying decisions, and the many last-minute buying decisions cause increased stress on sales.</p>
<p>Despite this, the core principles of supporting and leading a remote team don’t change. If anything, you have to lean into your values more when uncertainty increases.</p>
<p>My Core Principles for Managing Remotely</p>
<p>For me, the core principles of managing a remote team are:</p>
<p>Lead with compassion. Communicate clearly. Trust your people. Nurture teamwork. Promote friendly — not cutthroat — competition. Implement smart processes .</p>
<p>Compassion</p>
<p>As a manager, I make it a policy to lead from the front but to do so with compassion. Family comes first — always. With school schedules being in flux, it is important to maintain flexibility around job responsibilities and understand that employees may not always be able to work core business hours. I am always ready to jump in when a teammate needs extra support, whether that’s covering a sales call or helping execute a contract.</p>
<p>In times like these, I also stress that travel is completely optional. These policies aren’t just hot air. I model this behavior so my team feels valued and trusted when unexpected issues arise. As they say, if you talk the talk, you’ve got to walk the walk.</p>

<p>Communication</p>
<p>Communication is essential to success in any environment, and that truth is only heightened in the current moment we’re living through. Be human and encourage your team to be comfortable with difficult conversations. I find daily standups are helpful when checking my team’s temperature and ensuring we are clearly communicating. Being open and respectful of your team prevents a lot of headaches in the long run.</p>
<p>Trust</p>
<p>One thing that has helped me tremendously over the years is finding good people and trusting them to do their jobs. I have a history of hiring reps I’ve worked with in the past. I support them when they need help, but I never take over because I trust they will do everything they can to get the job done.</p>
<p>If someone on my team is struggling, I try to find out the underlying issue. Usually, something going on in their personal life has caused them to lose focus, and then their motivation slips. My goal is to help them mentally find peace and balance to get them back on track. This may be a sympathetic ear to vent, a couple days off, or maybe a project that is a change of pace. Reality is there are many ways to help the great person you hired get back on track, just have an honest conversation and understand what is going on so you can find a path forward together.</p>
<p>Teamwork</p>
<p>Building a sense of camaraderie is important to any remote team. I encourage my team to work together to lift everyone up by promoting a culture of team success alongside individual success. While it’s great to be the number-one salesperson, it’s even better to be the number-one salesperson on the number-one team. I promote a culture where everyone is on the same team working toward the same goal.</p>
<p>Friendly Competition</p>
<p>Following on teamwork, our internal contests are friendly, not cutthroat. Competitions are great for building momentum — but only if they are fun and cooperative. For example, we recently had a contest where the prize was a kegerator. As part of the competition, we had daily standup meetings not just for tracking, but also for sharing ideas and promoting creativity. My team was able to cheer each other on while still competing with each other.</p>
<p>Smart Processes</p>
<p>One last but important piece of advice is to be smart with your time by having good processes in place. Whenever my team identifies a bottleneck, we work together to streamline the process. For example, at the end of the quarter when time was critical, we were getting bogged down with legal, so I began acting as the single point of contact between the reps and the legal team. I had daily standups with legal to keep the process on track and avoid each rep spending time tracking things down. This freed up the reps’ time so they could sell, and legal had requests coming from only one person.</p>
<p>Every Quarter Is Now Year-End</p>
<p>In a typical year, our customers hold on to their budget until their year ends. This results in a hockey-stick sales curve, where the majority of deals are done at the end of the last quarter. Currently, we’re seeing a similar cycle, but on a quarterly basis, which is what I call the “Hockey Stick Sales Curve on Steroids.”</p>
<p>Customers are not putting off purchases until the end of the year; instead, they are waiting until the last two weeks of each quarter to make sure their business is doing well. Once they are sure their business is meeting expectations, they spend their budget before they lose it.</p>
<p>This change puts stress on my sales team. To support them, I remind sales that our customers’ procurement and legal teams are overloaded. Sales can help the customer stay organized and set timelines to create a sense of urgency on both sides to avoid delays. Remember, procurement wants to get this off their plate too — they just need to make sure they are fighting for the best possible solution. So don&rsquo;t play games!</p>
<p>How to Hire and Retain High-Performing Teammates</p>
<p>When hiring, there are two things I look for in a candidate: curiosity and chemistry.</p>
<p>Curiosity is the single most important quality when it comes to hiring. I look for someone with natural curiosity who strives to understand the how and why of a deal. Technology and product can be taught. Curiosity and asking the right questions cannot.</p>
<p>When it comes to chemistry, the candidate should reflect the team’s culture. I avoid candidates with negative attitudes. Same for candidates who are only in it for themselves. A self-centered person will not raise the team up.</p>
<p>Putting Your People First Ensures Everyone’s Success</p>
<p>The bottom line is that if you value your team, remain flexible, work together, and communicate clearly, you’ll get through any period of uncertainty, including a global pandemic.</p>
<p>My team recently asked for an in-person QBR because they missed seeing each other face to face. I take this as a marker of high-praise and success that they want to spend time together. We made this happen, while stressing that it was completely optional. In fact, several team members opted out, we supported them for their choice.</p>
<p>That’s because my focus is always on what’s best for my people. Communicating, listening, putting their needs first, and building a fun team is how I lead from the front with compassion. The results speak for themselves.</p>

<h3 id="netsky-goes-back-to-his-roots-with-new-album-second-nature">&ldquo;Netsky goes back to his roots with new album ‘Second Nature’&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://weraveyou.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/netsky.jpg" alt="img">
Netsky goes back to his roots with new album ‘Second Nature’: Listen</p>
<p>By Ellie Mullins 38</p>
<p>Earlier this year, it was announced that drum and bass pioneer Netsky would be making his return to Hospital Records. A decade ago was when he made his debut there and forever changed the genre, and fans had eagerly been waiting to see if him and the label would pair up again. With the Belgian producer exploring other genres and expanding his music horizons over the years, he has returned to his roots for his new album ‘Second Nature’ and it’s been a long time coming.</p>
<p>We had already gotten a taste of the extra special project when the single ‘I See The Future in Your Eyes’ dropped back in April, and from there on we knew that this was going to give us heavy nostalgic vibes and take us on a journey to the past, when his career was starting out. Reminiscent of his older style, he then went on to drop ‘Mixed Emotions’ and ‘Blend’, featuring collaborations with Rudimental, Montell2099 and Afronaut Zu, and the excitement for ‘Second Nature’ had truly exploded by that point. Now, the full album is finally out and he’s delivered a true masterpiece to say the least.</p>
<p>Hold On (feat. Becky Hill)</p>
<p>Setting the theme and tone for the album perfectly, this track is extremely reminiscent of his older work, and definitely throws us into a pool of nostalgia. With emotive vocals from Becky Hill and a simple yet effective drum and bass drop that’s bound to get anyone moving, this couldn’t have been more of a perfect opener to ‘Second Nature’.</p>
<p>Mixed Emotions (feat. Montell2099)</p>
<p>Serving as the second single to be released prior to the album, ‘Mixed Emotions’ proved to be extremely popular with his fanbase. With nearly 2 million streams on Spotify so far, this showed us the darker, moodier side to Netsky’s production skills. Serving up classic liquid drum and bass vibes, it’s a fan favourite and we can definitely see why.</p>
<p>Destiny (feat. Jozzy) [with Sub Focus]</p>
<p>One of the most exciting collaborations on the album, ‘Destiny’ sees Sub Focus injecting his signature style of drum and bass into a concoction of light-hearted, energetic synths. Netsky and Sub Focus are two of the biggest names in this realm, and seeing them team up is nothing less than exciting to say the least. A long time coming, we hope this leads to more collaborations in the future! This one deserves to be heard loud and proud.</p>
<p>I Choose You</p>
<p>The first track to not feature any collaborators, this one is essential Netsky. At his very best, it feels like returning to the older sound but with a fresh 2020 update. Like a breath of fresh air, he knows exactly how to lighten the mood with his uplifting style of music, and this is perfect to warm us up during the winter months. Definitely one to stick on repeat again and again, ‘I Choose You’ is a gem.</p>
<p>Broken Bottles</p>
<p>Piano notes + powerful vocals = a recipe for success. During the buildup to the track, it seems like its going to be a more toned down, moody track but then the drop comes in to shatter all preconceptions. A surefire dancefloor filler, you can’t help but smile and nod your head at the very least whilst listening to this.</p>
<p>Blend (feat. Afronaut Zu) [with Rudimental)</p>
<p>Also previously released as a single, this collaboration with Rudimental and Afronaut Zu is totally different from anything we’ve ever heard before from Netsky. Further proving himself as a versatile whirlwind of talent, this is one seriously funky track that will stay stuck in our heads for a long time.</p>
<p>Let Me Hold You [with Hybrid Minds]</p>
<p>Another emotive track with soulful drum and bass duo Hybrid Minds, expectations were extremely high for this track when the full tracklist was revealed, and they did not disappoint at all. In fact, they blew any expectations out of the water completely. ‘Let Me Hold You’ will have you dancing with tears in your eyes thanks to the overpowering emotions sewed into the fibres of the track.</p>
<p>Look at Me Go (feat. Darren Styles)</p>
<p>Fans of the harder, faster style of electronic music will feel well represented with ‘Look at Me Go’. With the lyrics repeating the words ‘look at me go’ constantly and earth-shaking synths accompanying the lyrics, its impossible not to love this one.</p>
<p>Don’t Care What People Say</p>
<p>At first listen, this may strike listeners as very Daft Punk-esque. The robotic vocals are unmistakably reminiscent of Daft Punk type sounds, and this is an all-round groovy banger. Seemingly having more of a house vibe rather than a drum and bass vibe, it’s a true joy to listen to.</p>
<p>Complicated</p>
<p>With dream-like soundscapes, ‘Complicated’ feels like being transported to a world above the clouds, floating and being surrounded by nothing but good vibes. Much like the other tracks, this also features vocals that listeners will be more than inclined to sing along to.</p>
<p>Free</p>
<p>One of the biggest blasts to the past, ‘Free’ wants to take us back to the year of 2009, around when he was first signed to Hospital Records. ‘Free’ is a love letter to the start of his discography as an established artist with a fresh coat of paint, showing how far he’s come since then.</p>
<p>I See The Future in Your Eyes</p>
<p>‘I See The Future in Your Eyes’ was the first time we were introduced to this project, and so it holds an extremely important place in the very heart and soul of the album. Letting us all know that the Netsky everyone fell in love with was back and better than ever, and ready to dominate 2020, the scene exploded when this was released. Even now, it hasn’t gotten old a single bit and will definitely become a classic staple within Netsky’s discography.</p>
<p>Waiting All Day to Get to You</p>
<p>This one may surprise listeners at first, because the opening seconds sounds like it has come straight out of the pop scene but as we carry on travelling through the track, it becomes nothing short of an infectious banger. It perfectly encapsulates the feeling of nostalgia and manages to turn it into sound, which is not an easy feat by all means.</p>
<p>Power (feat. Urbandawn)</p>
<p>Dominating 2019 with his ‘Come Together’ anthem, Urbandawn found himself dominating the scene and landing a place within the Hospital Records family. His different style of drum and bass sees his rock and metal influences absorbed into a drum and bass package, creating a heavier tone, and it certainly shines through on ‘Power‘. Mixed in with Netsky’s brighter sound, it proves that opposites attract.</p>
<p>Float</p>
<p>Another one with just Netsky taking the reigns, the plucky guitar sounds open us up to a funky world created by ‘Float’. Another track that makes us feel like we’re floating – meaning the track has a very suitable title -, the distorted drop snaps us out of the dream state and takes us on a thrilling ride.</p>
<p>Dreaming of You (feat. Elias)</p>
<p>Fans may recognise the name Elias from back a couple of years ago when Netsky remixed Elias’ track ‘Focus’, and now the pair have delightedly teamed up for a collaboration and ‘Dreaming of You’ makes us wish that this had happened sooner. It’s as if Elias’ vocals were handcrafted to perfectly fit into the world of a Netsky track, and the pair are a bona fide match made in heaven.</p>
<p>Everybody Loves the Sunshine (feat. Daddy Waku &amp; Chantal Kashala)</p>
<p>It’s true that everybody loves the sunshine, and this track is simply sunshine embodied and encapsulated into one track. Like a hot summer day, this does the job of making us feel all warm inside and it is just what the world needs right now.</p>
<p>Basic Instinct</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this serves as the last track from the album when we wish it could go on for much longer. Serving as a brilliant closer for the album, ‘Basic Instinct’ goes back to basics and feels like Netsky is time travelling back to the past to visit it again, and he’s taking us all with him. It truly reviews just how far he’s come as a producer within the scene, and makes us smile with pride and joy.</p>
<p>Overall, ‘Second Nature’ is an emotional love letter to his entire career so far. As said by Netsky himself, it’s about connecting with his past and he couldn’t have done it in a better way. ‘Second Nature’ is now available worldwide. Listen to it in full on Spotify below, and other streaming sites here, including physical CD and vinyl options on the Hospital Records website.

<h3 id="marianne-vydra-athletics-is-a-relationship-endeavor">&ldquo;Marianne Vydra: “Athletics is a relationship endeavor”&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://osubeavers.com/images/2020/10/30/op_1_.png?preset=large.socialmediaimage" alt="img">
, who has dedicated the last 28 years to assisting, overseeing and mentoring Oregon State student-athletes, coaches, alumni and staff will leave her position as Deputy Athletic Director for Administration and Senior Woman Administrator (SWA) on Oct. 30, 2020.Vydra leaves Oregon State Athletics as one of the longest-tenured and most-decorated administrators in the department&rsquo;s history.&ldquo;It has been an honor to serve nearly 3,000 student-athletes that graced the campus at Oregon State University,&rdquo; Vydra said. &ldquo;I have been able to meet and team up with extraordinary coaches and administrators during my tenure. I have also had the luxury of longevity, which allowed me to facilitate the weaving of generations of former student-athletes back into our fold.&ldquo;I am especially grateful for my tribe of mentors and friends that have allowed me into their lives along the way. Athletics is a relationship endeavor and I am grateful for everyone who has touched my life in some manner, especially our student-athletes.&ldquo;Vydra was appointed to several NCAA committees, won numerous awards, served as Oregon State&rsquo;s interim Athletics Director two times and, most important, established a relationship with coaches and student-athletes that will last forever.&ldquo;Over her career Marianne has made significant and lasting contributions to intercollegiate athletics both nationally and at Oregon State,&rdquo; Beaver Vice President and Director of Athleticssaid. &ldquo;She is a true citizen of our industry, giving of her time and talents to various NCAA and conference committees over the years. Her vibrant passion and care for our student-athletes and coaches will be one of her many lasting legacies.&ldquo;The legend of Vydra&rsquo;s long run at Oregon State began in 1992 when she arrived in Corvallis after previously serving as an Academic Counselor at the University of Maine, a position she held as a graduate assistantship.&ldquo;When I arrived on my first day of work, I immediately immersed myself in developing a strategic plan for the Academic Services Unit,&rdquo; Vydra said. &ldquo;As I recall, there were four computers in the study hall area upstairs in Gill Coliseum when I started. I became heavily involved nationally in the National Association for Athletics Academic Advisors (N4A) and was able to bring valuable resources to the unit as we grew.&ldquo;Vydra credits Margaret Zillioux as &ldquo;a formidable mentor who taught me to understand my work from my center, which was based on an ethos of fairness and social-justice and providing opportunities for student-athletes at every turn. She introduced me to the great teachings of Dr. Harry Edwards.&ldquo;She is also grateful to Mary Alice Stander, her direct supervisor, and former Senior Woman Administrator&rsquo;s Patti French and Robyn Sharp &ldquo;who all mentored me during those early years and were strong women who I learned different aspects of the industry from.&ldquo;In 1997, Vydra received OSU&rsquo;s Women&rsquo;s Center Woman of Achievement Award for advancing gender equity and social justice measures in athletics, as well as on campus.&ldquo;During this same time, the membership of the President&rsquo;s Commission on the Status of Women provided immeasurable personal and professional support for me,&rdquo; Vydra said. &ldquo;Dr. Janet Lee, Dr. Stephanie Sanford, Dr. Laura Rice, the late Dr. Alexis Walker and countless other powerful women came together during this insanely divisive, yet extremely radical time in OSU&rsquo;s history. As I look back on this era during the state-wide and local anti-gay ballot measure period, it was a hard time for the students and staff and we came out stronger in the end because of the strong support on campus and in this community. I look at the Pride Center on campus today, as culminating evidence of what a community can do together for the common good of everyone.&quot;&rsquo;s OSU legacy is hard to put into words,&rdquo; said former Oregon State women&rsquo;s soccer player Claire Brown. &ldquo;It supersedes the trophies, awards, the titles and victories. She was not only a trailblazer, she was a fierce and powerful mentor for so many of us. She was the reason we went back to OSU to visit. She was the reason we donated to the programs. She was the glue that kept us all together. Her departure will leave a void that I&rsquo;m certain OSU will never be able to fill.&ldquo;In 1998, Vydra was promoted to the Director of Academic Services and named the Senior Woman Administrator by Mitch Barnhart, the current Athletics Director at the University of Kentucky. Vydra leaves her position behind only Arizona&rsquo;s Rocky LaRose and Washington State&rsquo;s Marcia Saneholtz as the second-longest tenured SWA in the Pac-12 Conference.&ldquo;I owe Mitch much gratitude for believing in me and giving me a chance to spread my wings,&rdquo; Vydra said. &ldquo;I always say he was the paddle that shocked our hearts when he hired Dennis Erickson. Mitch had a vision and one that included winning. I loved that about him.&ldquo;&ldquo;In 1998, Oregon State was blessed by the presence of a young man that Coach Riley recruited in Ken Simonton,&rdquo; Vydra added. &ldquo;We asked a lot of Ken both on and off the field. It was Ken who would inspire us to create programming for black student-athletes and allow them to build community, break bread and host conversations on topics of the student&rsquo;s choosing. It was Ken and Dr. Larry Roper, former Vice President for Student Affairs, who really spearheaded this early programming. Larry provided financial support to get the vision off the ground.&ldquo;&ldquo;Twenty-eight years is a long time to serve any vision and yet it still feels too soon to see Marianne go,&rdquo; said former Oregon State football standout Ken Simonton. &ldquo;I cannot think of many meaningful programs or original concepts that didn&rsquo;t pass through her door. She has been faithful to the vision of Beaver Nation and always supported the goals and vision of many student-athletes along the way. I count myself amongst those ranks. Marianne will forever be cherished.&ldquo;As the Senior Woman Administrator, Vydra was asked to oversee several sports, in addition to the Academic Services Center. She used her experience as a former volleyball student-athlete and manager at Missouri State University, and took the lessons she learned from AVCA Hall of Fame Coach Linda Dollar, the late Hall of Fame Administrator Dr. Mary Jo Wynn and Hall of Fame Women&rsquo;s Basketball Coach Cheryl Burnett.&ldquo;I was in the right place at the right time to be able to learn from these strong women who were also extremely competitive,&rdquo; Vydra said. &ldquo;Their records speak for themselves and we shared a common determination. Cheryl reached the NCAA Women&rsquo;s Basketball Tournament Final Four, twice; quite the accomplishment for a mid-major program. What I learned from her is the obvious in that you can always outwork people; and, the most important aspect of winning, IS the people you put on your team. I got to reach back to my years as a student-athlete and set into motion all of the aspects I learned from these women to assist the coaches at OSU.During Marianne&rsquo;s tenure as the SWA, she would represent the conference for 16 years on different NCAA Championship Committees.Vydra credits NCAA Softball Championship staff members Chris Pohl and Sharon Cessna for expanding their reach of the NCAA Softball championship in Oklahoma City and with its relationship to the University of Oklahoma and long-time administrator Lindy Roberts. She is very appreciative of the work Carol Stiff, Vice President of Programming at ESPN, did to expand the national exposure of the Women&rsquo;s College World Series.&ldquo;I met so many wonderful coaches and student-athletes in this time period, it&rsquo;s hard for me to fathom it all,&rdquo; Vydra said. &ldquo;All of the sport administrators and coaches that served and are serving on that committee have done amazing work for the student-athletes, the coaches, and that sport.&ldquo;Vydra was appointed to the Women&rsquo;s Soccer Committee in 2007 and selected to the NCAA Women&rsquo;s Gymnastics Committee in 2013.&ldquo;I joined the Women&rsquo;s Gymnastics conversation at the right opportunity to influence the new format for the current NCAA Gymnastics Championship,&rdquo; Vydra said. &ldquo;I cannot overstate the vision that ESPN&rsquo;s Carol Stiff and Megan Aronowitz have had for that sport for quite some time to bring elite women&rsquo;s gymnastics into our living rooms. Tanya andspent hours with me to help me understand the goals of the Collegiate Coaches' Association.&ldquo;Of the many highlights in Vydra&rsquo;s illustrious career at Oregon State, the best might have been the creation of Beavers Without Borders, a service-learning study abroad program developed as a collaboration between OSU Athletics and OSU International Programs. Former Oregon State football player Taylor Kavanaugh had the idea. Former Oregon State Athletics Directorwas its champion. Vydra made it happen. The first trip took place in 2011, after just six months of planning.&ldquo;With the help of Michele Justice who made this happen from a campus perspective, we were on a plane to Guatemala with Rashaad Reynolds, Marcus Wheaton, Johnnie Hekker, Lance Mitchell, Yvenson Bernard, Mandi Rodriguez, Brittney Belshe,, and Taylor Kavanaugh&rsquo;s camera and crew, in short order,&rdquo; Vydra said.Beavers Without Borders has since engaged countless student-athletes to this day.&ldquo;I thank(Senior Associate Athletic Director for Student-Athlete Development) for carrying the ball. I also want to thank Dr. David Bernell (College of Liberal Arts) and Julie Walkin (OSU GO) for their support of the program as well.&ldquo;&ldquo;MV was a great partner of mine as we developed the Everyday Champions program at OSU,&rdquo; said, the current Athletics Director at Georgia Tech University. &ldquo;Marianne was a champion for any opportunity to enhance the student-athlete experience. Beavers Without Borders is a great example of the projects we collaborated on. Her sheer passion, energy and commitment to the student-athletes made it happen.&ldquo;In 2015, Vydra was named one of the Top 10 Senior Woman Administrators in the NCAA by CollegeAD.com.&ldquo;I want to thank Chris Hoyles, Chris Dawson, Gloria Nevarez and Teresa Gould for their mentorship and guidance in my career,&rdquo; Vydra said. &ldquo;They have done things behind the scenes at the Pac-12 that have bolstered all of our women&rsquo;s basketball programs in the conference and across the country. I want to thank, his staff and all of the student-athletes who gave me the memory of the win over Baylor during that Final Four run.&ldquo;&ldquo;I have fond memories of building the strategic plan that&rsquo;s resulted in the recent elite performance of the Pac-12 Women&rsquo;s Basketball programs in the NCAA Women&rsquo;s Basketball Tournament. My fellow SWA sisters disrupted the status quo in NCAA Women&rsquo;s Basketball for sure; these women are the most talented administrators in college athletics and I feel so blessed to have worked with them. Lisa Peterson (SWA at UO) and I have had the shared vision for elite women&rsquo;s basketball in the state of Oregon for quite some time. I will miss her and our frequent lively rivalry banter.&ldquo;&ldquo;I have been fortunate for nearly 20 years to callboth colleague and friend,&rdquo; said Teresa Gould, who is the Senior Associate Commissioner, Sports Management &amp; Institutional Services at the Pac-12 Conference. &ldquo;She has inspired me and so many others through her unwavering commitment to supporting student-athletes, advocating on their behalf, and encouraging their holistic development. Marianne has served tirelessly on various committees on the Oregon State campus, within the Pac-12 Conference, and across the NCAA. She has left an extraordinary legacy through the decades of colleagues she has influenced and generations of student-athletes she has mentored. Our industry has benefitted from her leadership immeasurably and she will be greatly missed.&ldquo;&ldquo;The namewill forever be associated in the Pac-12 Conference with Oregon State athletics and student-athlete advocacy,&rdquo; said Lisa Peterson, who is the Deputy Athletic Director/SWA/Deputy Title IX Coordinator at the University of Oregon. &ldquo;We might have been rivals on game day, but Marianne was a kindred spirit who never lost sight of the big picture: our shared ideals of student-athlete welfare and advocacy for women in college athletics. We will miss her unforgettable laugh, we will miss her voice when decisions were being made, and we will miss her leadership that paved the way for so many who followed in her footsteps.&ldquo;Vydra was appointed Oregon State&rsquo;s interim Athletics Director in 2015 and again in 2016, while the university interviewed candidates to lead the athletic department. She received the Beaver Champion Award from then-Oregon State President Dr. Edward Ray in 2018. &ldquo;I want to thank Dr. Ray for his friendship and believing in me my entire career,&rdquo; Vydra said.She most recently became just the second woman nominated to serve on the NCAA Division I Baseball Committee. She also served more than 10 years as the sport supervisor for Oregon State&rsquo;s three-time national championship baseball program. &ldquo;I want to thank NCAA Staff member, Randy Buhr, for his long-time support of my career; I consider him a friend. And I have fond memories of Ray Tanner, the AD from South Carolina who was our Chair my first year; he might have one of the more complex jobs in the industry and he has a grace about him that I really enjoyed.&ldquo;&ldquo;One of my most enjoyable experiences at Oregon State was assistingand the team with the 2018 NCAA National Championship,&rdquo; Vydra said. &ldquo;It was a whole team effort. I think my time here is summed up best by Kyle Nobach&rsquo;s famous quote: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m smiling too hard, I think I&rsquo;m going to break my face.'&ldquo;&ldquo;Facilitating pinnacle experiences on and off the courts and fields for young people as they are shaping their full identities is a true privilege. I love seeing student-athletes and coaches shine when everything comes together for them.&ldquo;Three of Oregon State&rsquo;s most successful coaches have nothing but the utmost respect for Vydra and the work she has done for Beaver Nation.From former Oregon State baseball coach&quot;Marianne has always been a dedicated and committed advocate of advancing student-athletes to the very best. That started a long time ago when I was coaching and she was the academic advisor. I truly appreciate the time I had working with her. She has always been great and Oregon State will miss her.&ldquo;From Oregon State gymnastics coach&quot;Marianne has had a positive and lasting impact on our student-athletes and staff. Her compassion, loyalty and innovation has been a constant source of energy throughout the years. It has been a privilege and an honor to work with her for the last 24 years. She has imparted a legacy of excellence and success on our department and program. I am deeply grateful for her leadership, mentorship and guidance she has provided me over my career.&ldquo;From Oregon State women&rsquo;s basketball coach&quot;Throughout our decade together, Marianne has consistently been there for our women&rsquo;s basketball program, and for me personally, through every high and low with understanding, encouragement and wisdom. She saw something in me that led her to believe a Division III coach could get the job done at the highest level of college athletics, and then did everything in her power to set us up for success.&ldquo;It is difficult to overstate Marianne&rsquo;s unique impact on our program and our department overall. She had the time and energy for each person associated with our program, and used her relentless positivity to lift each of us higher. A constant encourager, Marianne gave each of us every ounce of energy she had. I consider it a blessing to have worked with her, and I want to thank Marianne for her sacrifices and investment in each of us. I will miss her and am excited to follow her next adventures.&ldquo;As for her next chapter, Vydra shared this: &ldquo;I have a lot of gas in my tank. I think a vacation is still 100 miles in the woods with a pack on my back with no Mountain Dew in sight. I am blessed with an incredible network, and I am taking some time with my family and friends and to be still and listen. This is a pivotal time for the industry, the country and for the planet.&rdquo;
